On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(n)) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where n is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(n) comparisons.

 coder Can you please explain how is the complexity O(log log n) …. Also, please explain these lines of the code gievn at the wikipedia page : if (sortedArray[low] == toFind) return low; why do we need to check this condition after coming out of the while loop ?? Poorna Durga Yeddu What is uniformly distributed array? GeeksforGeeks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(discrete) Poorna Durga Yeddu So, that is the probability of occurrence of every key is same.
