The basic method is to compare a map generated at the current robot position with a previously generated map of the environment in order to probabilistically maximize the agreement between the maps. This method is able to operate in both indoor and outdoor environments using either discrete features or an occupancy grid to represent the world map. The map may be generated using any method to detect features in the robot's surroundings, including vision, sonar, and laser range-finder. We perform an efficient global search of the pose space that guarantees that the best position is found according to the probabilistic map agreement measure in a discretized pose space. In addition, subpixel localization and uncertainty estimation are performed by fitting the likelihood function with a parameterized surface. We describe the application of these techniques in several experiments Published in: Robotics and Automation, IEEE Transactions on  (Volume:16 ,  Issue: 1 ) Page(s): 55 - 66 ISSN : 1042-296X INSPEC Accession Number: 6570748 DOI: 10.1109/70.833191 Date of Publication : Feb 2000 Date of Current Version : Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002 Issue Date : Feb 2000 Sponsored by : IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Publisher: IEEE Author(s) Olson, C.F.
