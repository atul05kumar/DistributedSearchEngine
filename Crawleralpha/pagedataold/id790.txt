For example, if the given array is {“cat”, “dog”, “tac”, “god”, “act”}, then output may be “cat tac act dog god”. We have discussed two different methods in the previous post. In this post, a more efficient solution is discussed. Trie data structure can be used for a more efficient solution. Insert the sorted order of each word in the trie. Since all the anagrams will end at the same leaf node. We can start a linked list at the leaf nodes where each node represents the index of the original array of words. Finally, traverse the Trie. While traversing the Trie, traverse each linked list one line at a time. Following are the detailed steps. 1) Create an empty Trie 2) One by one take all words of input sequence. Do following for each word …a) Copy the word to a buffer. …b) Sort the buffer …c) Insert the sorted buffer and index of this word to Trie. Each leaf node of Trie is head of a Index list. The Index list stores index of words in original sequence. If sorted buffe is already present, we insert index of this word to the index list. 3) Traverse Trie. While traversing, if you reach a leaf node, traverse the index list. And print all words using the index obtained from Index list.

Please use ideone.com and share the link here. Tarzan Trie is such a complex solution. Here is a much easier Java solution Create a HashMap of the type <String, List> The key string here will be the sorted string and list will contain all the strings from the input array which corresponds to the sorted key. For example: cat and tac will have the same key as act. So its hashmap entry will be act : cat -> tac At the end, just traverse over the entire keyset of the hashmap. alien What is time complexity for this solution? wgpshashank Just writing some quick points , let me know if anything wrong here . 1.keeping index is not necessary since you are already sort the work and then adding to trie , after sorting just search that word (O(k) k is constant here if that exist in trie just add it linked list which is leaf node..no index is needed .. while printing anagram you just need print all such linked list which contains anagrams grouped together in each list , thus extra overhead can be removed. 2. Lets talk about complexity , is it better then hashmap approach ? we are sorting n words which O(nmlogm) m is length of string , n is no of strings insertion in O(n) in trie. Overall O(nmlogm) which is same as HashTable so we are not getting any benefit, which should have been instead . Mukul Rawal Assign each character a unique number. Let’s say a prime number. For eg: a=2, b=3, c=5, so on and so forth. Now, for a string add each character’s corresponding unique number, For eg. ‘cat’ becomes 5+2+71= 78. Now we will have all the anagrams with same number as the sum of their characters unique number will be same. We can create a bucket linked list with these numbers and print the corresponding elements in each bucket of the linked list. Shubhankar Srivastava by that logic “ef (11 + 13)” is same as “ch (5 + 19)”. I think we can group all the strings with the same length and same sum, and then check for anagrams by calculating the frequency of characters in each string and comparing it with other strings to check if they are anagrams or not. Vu Duc Minh Hashing with the summation of irrational number like sqrt(2), sqrt(3) … is even better and can handle overflow. Satya What will be the space and time complexity of this code?? abhishek08aug Intelligent sreeram i think instead of hash tables we can have a int num in the trie node which can make it much easier lets say the 5th string is inserted and the num will be 5 lets say we get the anagram of the string at 7 th string we can update num to be 5*10+7 =57 in the end we can finally split the number to print them sreeram I meant instead of linked lists Aashish The idea seems good. But, it is limited to addressing the anagrams upto a range, like INT_MAX. memo Could you please give complexity analysis of above program?  
/* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
 Palash I think, trie of hash-table would be more efficient. R I am not able to visualize trie DS. Can you please add one diagram as well to indicate index and trie nodes ?
