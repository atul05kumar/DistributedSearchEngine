Get Access Abstract The Min Cut Linear Arrangement problem asks, for a given graphG and a positive integerk, if there exists a linear arrangement ofG's vertices so that any line separating consecutive vertices in the layout cuts at mostk of the edges. A variation of this problem insists that the arrangement be made on a (fixed-degree) tree instead of a line. We show that (1) this problem isNP-complete even whenG is planar; (2) it is easily solved whenG is a tree; and (3) there is a simple characterization for all graphs with cost 2 or less. Our main result is a linear-time algorithm to embed an outerplanar graphG into a spanning tree with cost at most maxdegree(G) + 1. This result is important because it extends to an approximation algorithm for the standard Min Cut Linear Arrangement Problem on outerplanar graphs. Supported in part by NSF Grant CCR-8710730.
