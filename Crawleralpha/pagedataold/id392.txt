However there are also dark times in the industry when B-town loses out on its younger talents. Over the years, Bollywood has lost great talent to death. We take a look at Bollywood celebrities who passed away at an early age. These celebrities are still remembered for the remarkable work they did before their untimely death.  Bollywood celebrities who died young /bollywood-celebrities-who-died-young/eventshow/39155895.cms 02 Jiah Khan: The death of Jiah Khan created a stir in the industry. This young and budding talent was reportedly found dead at her apartment in Juhu in June 2013. She was just 25. As an immediate consequence of the death, Jiah Khan's alleged boyfriend Sooraj Panscholi was arrested on charges of abetment to suicide. According to a report in The Times of India, a six paged letter allegedly written by Jiah was found by the police and that Jiah Khan's mother, Rabia Khan had questioned the suicide theory. In an interview with The Times of India, Rabia Khan opened up about her daughter, saying, "Reports that my daughter was depressed because of work is all rubbish. She was fine; she was sincere, pure and not manipulative at all. She could not stand lies, deception and lies from the only one she loved the most. I am not being revengeful but telling the truth. She fell for a wrong guy." According to a Mumbai Mirror report, the Pancholis had filed a 100 crore defamation case against Rabia Khan. While the legalities are on, Bollywood remembers Jiah as the sensuous beauty of Nishabd.  Bollywood celebrities who died young /bollywood-celebrities-who-died-young/eventshow/39155891.cms 03 Divya Bharti: Bollywood lost another starlet with the demise of Divya Bharti at a young age. She was only 19 years old when she died falling from the fifth floor of her Versova apartment. She was a rising talent in films and her death came as a huge shock for the industry. In an interview with idiva, Divya's mother Mita described her as a lovely child who wasn't fond of studying. Divya had married Sajid Nadiadwala at an early age. Speaking about the same, Divya's mother told idiva, “I knew she was married. I’d never have been able to stop her. I supported her so that she’d continue confiding in me and wouldn’t head in another direction.” Reveals Mita in the interview, “They must have had normal tiffs. Sajid and Divya were only together for eight months. Where did they have the time to enjoy life? She was not ambitious. Her aim in life was to marry and have children. She’d joke, ‘I’ll throw my kids in your lap and go to work’.”  Bollywood celebrities who died young /bollywood-celebrities-who-died-young/eventshow/39155888.cms 04 Smita Patil: She was another one of Bollywood's most loved actresses. Smita Patil had proved her acting prowess with a lot of films, and had a career bejeweled with awards. She was a National Award winner and also a much applauded actress. However her personal life has been debated a lot. She fell in love with Raj Babbar and the two got married. They had a kid, Prateik Babbar. She reportedly died, two weeks after Prateik was born, due to childbirth complications. However things have been strained between Prateik and Raj Babbar. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Prateik said, "Dad was never around while I was growing up. He was always busy with his other family and I had to go and meet him at their house. Why did my mother pass away? It still hurts to come to terms with this reality. Over to movies." While Raj Babbar too has his side of the story, talking to Mumbai Mirror, he said, "So far I've felt that if the truth hurts the people close to you, it is not worth telling. I've always thought about my family. And that surely includes Prateik. The good of my family is my primary concern. However, now everyone feels that it's about time I told my version of the truth. And I agree."  Bollywood celebrities who died young /bollywood-celebrities-who-died-young/eventshow/39155884.cms 05 Taruni Sachdev: Popularly known as the Rasna girl, Taruni Sachdev passed away in a plane crash in Nepal in 2012. She was only 14 years old then, but had worked in numerous advertisements and had done films too. She was the face of Rasna advertisements, and the cute girl became very popular with it. According to a report in The Times of India, Taruni aspired to become an actress, and had told director Vinayan T G (who introduced her to films in 2004), "Uncle, I want to do the heroine's role in your film." She had also done a remarkable role in Amitabh Bachchan's Paa. Big B was shocked with the news. "Shocked and deeply grieved on learning of the tragic end of Taruni. Taruni, a talented little child, who played much beyond her years, cute, confident and so immensely lovable. My prayers!" Big B wrote on Twitter.  Bollywood celebrities who died young 01 02 03 04 05 pagination.cms?msid=39154613&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
