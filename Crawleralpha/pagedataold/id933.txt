Question 16 Which of the following system calls results in the sending of SYN packets? A socket B bind C listen D connect Discuss it Question 16 Explanation:  socket() creates a new socket of a certain socket type, identified by an integer number, and allocates system resources to it. bind() is typically used on the server side, and associates a socket with a socket address structure, i.e. a specified local port number and IP address. listen() is used on the server side, and causes a bound TCP socket to enter listening state. connect() is used on the client side, and assigns a free local port number to a socket. In case of a TCP socket, it causes an attempt to establish a new TCP connection. When connect() is called by client, following three way handshake happens to establish the connection in TCP. 1) The client requests a connection by sending a SYN (synchronize) message to the server. 2) The server acknowledges this request by sending SYN-ACK back to the client. 3) The client responds with an ACK, and the connection is established.

(D) h(n) = O(f(n)); g(n) = (f(n)) A A B B C C D D Discuss it Question 39 Explanation:  According to order of growth: h(n) < f(n) < g(n) (g(n) is asymptotically greater than f(n) and f(n) is asymptotically greater than h(n) ) We can easily see above order by taking logs of the given 3 functions

 Question 42 G is a graph on n vertices and 2n - 2 edges. The edges of G can be partitioned into two edge-disjoint spanning trees. Which of the following is NOT true for G? A For every subset of k vertices, the induced subgraph has at most 2k-2 edges B The minimum cut in G has at least two edges C There are two edge-disjoint paths between every pair to vertices D There are two vertex-disjoint paths between every pair of vertices Discuss it Question 42 Explanation:  Please refer Induced Subgraph Now take any graph with 4 or 5 vertices that follows given properties and you can observe that the option (A) is not true. Question 43 Consider the Quicksort algorithm. Suppose there is a procedure for finding a pivot element which splits the list into two sub-lists each of which contains at least one-fifth of the elements. Let T(n) be the number of comparisons required to sort n elements. Then A T(n) <= 2T(n/5) + n B T(n) <= T(n/5) + T(4n/5) + n C T(n) <= 2T(4n/5) + n D T(n) <= 2T(n/2) + n Discuss it Question 43 Explanation:  For the case where n/5 elements are in one subset, T(n/5) comparisons are needed for the first subset with n/5 elements, T(4n/5) is for the rest 4n/5 elements, and n is for finding the pivot. If there are more than n/5 elements in one set then other set will have less than 4n/5 elements and time complexity will be less than T(n/5) + T(4n/5) + n because recursion tree will be more balanced. Question 44 The subset-sum problem is defined as follows. Given a set of n positive integers, S = {a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,...,an} and positive integer W, is there a subset of S whose elements sum to W? A dynamic program for solving this problem uses a 2-dimensional Boolean array X, with n rows and W+1 columns. X[i, j], 1 <= i <= n, 0 <= j <= W, is TRUE if and only if there is a subset of {a1 ,a2 ,...,ai} whose elements sum to j. Which of the following is valid for 2 <= i <= n and ai <= j <= W? A X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] V X[i, j -ai] B X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] V X[i - 1, j - ai] C X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] V X[i, j - ai] D X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] V X[i -1, j - ai] Discuss it Question 44 Explanation:  X[I, j] (2 <= i <= n and ai <= j <= W), is true if any of the following is true 1) Sum of weights excluding ai is equal to j, i.e., if X[i-1, j] is true. 2) Sum of weights including ai is equal to j, i.e., if X[i-1, j-ai] is true so that we get (j – ai) + ai as j. Question 45 Dijkstra’s single source shortest path algorithm when run from vertex a in the below graph, computes the correct shortest path distance to A only vertex a B only vertices a, e, f, g, h C only vertices a, b, c, d D all the vertices Discuss it Question 45 Explanation:  Dijkstra’s single source shortest path is not guaranteed to work for graphs with negative weight edges, but it works for the given graph. Let us see... 
Let us run the 1st pass
b 1
b is minimum, so shortest distance to b is 1.

After 1st  pass, distances are
c 3, e -2.  
e is minimum, so shortest distance to e is -2

After 2nd pass, distances are
c 3, f 0.  
f is minimum, so shortest distance to f is 0

After 3rd pass, distances are
c 3, g 3.  
Both are same, let us take g. so shortest distance to g is 3.

After 4th pass, distances are
c 3, h 5  
c is minimum, so shortest distance to c is 3

After 5th pass, distances are
h  -2
h is minimum, so shortest distance to h is -2 Question 46 You are given the postorder traversal, P, of a binary search tree on the n elements 1, 2, ..., n. You have to determine the unique binary search tree that has P as its postorder traversal. What is the time complexity of the most efficient algorithm for doing this?
