Also given two vertices source ‘s’ and sink ‘t’ in the graph, find the maximum possible flow from s to t with following constraints: a) Flow on an edge doesn’t exceed the given capacity of the edge. b) Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and t. For example, consider the following graph from CLRS book. The maximum possible flow in the above graph is 23. 
Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm 
The following is simple idea of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:
1) Start with initial flow as 0.
2) While there is a augmenting path from source to sink. 
           Add this path-flow to flow.
3) Return flow. Time Complexity: Time complexity of the above algorithm is O(max_flow * E). We run a loop while there is an augmenting path. In worst case, we may add 1 unit flow in every iteration. Therefore the time complexity becomes O(max_flow * E). How to implement the above simple algorithm? Let us first define the concept of Residual Graph which is needed for understanding the implementation. Residual Graph of a flow network is a graph which indicates additional possible flow. If there is a path from source to sink in residual graph, then it is possible to add flow. Every edge of a residual graph has a value called residual capacity which is equal to original capacity of the edge minus current flow. Residual capacity is basically the current capacity of the edge. Let us now talk about implementation details. Residual capacity is 0 if there is no edge between to vertices of residual graph. We can initialize the residual graph as original graph as there is no initial flow and initially residual capacity is equal to original capacity. To find an augmenting path, we can either do a BFS or DFS of the residual graph. We have used BFS in below implementation. Using BFS, we can find out if there is a path from source to sink. BFS also builds parent[] array. Using the parent[] array, we traverse through the found path and find possible flow through this path by finding minimum residual capacity along the path. We later add the found path flow to overall flow. The important thing is, we need to update residual capacities in the residual graph. We subtract path flow from all edges along the path and we add path flow along the reverse edges We need to add path flow along reverse edges because may later need to send flow in reverse direction (See following video for example). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8MwfgB-lyM Following is C++ implementation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. To keep things simple, graph is represented as a 2D matrix.

    return 0;
}
 Output: The maximum possible flow is 23 The above implementation of Ford Fulkerson Algorithm is called Edmonds-Karp Algorithm. The idea of Edmonds-Karp is to use BFS in Ford Fulkerson implementation as BFS always picks a path with minimum number of edges. When BFS is used, the worst case time complexity can be reduced to O(VE2). The above implementation uses adjacency matrix representation though where BFS takes O(V2) time, the time complexity of the above implementation is O(EV3) (Refer CLRS book for proof of time complexity) This is an important problem as it arises in many practical situations. Examples include, maximizing the transportation with given traffic limits, maximizing packet flow in computer networks. Exercise: Modify the above implementation so that it that runs in O(VE2) time.

Thanks gourav pathak main() { int n; cin>>n; int *arr[n]; for(int i=0;i<n;i++) arr[i]=(int *)malloc(n*sizeof(int)); for(int i=0;i<n;i++) for(int j=0;j>arr[i][j]; int s,t; cin>>s>>t; FordFulkerson(arr,n,s,t); } //function prototype int FordFulkerson(int *arr[],int n,int s,int t); msy how do we send two dimensional array as a parameter without using pointer gourav pathak It is possible to send two dimensional array as a parameter without using pointers only if you know its dimensions…otherwise you have to use pointers(e.g void bfs(arr[][9]))………You might also store the 2-D array as a 1-D array where X[i*col+j]=arr[i][j]…then you simply pass the 1-D array and the dimensions Ram COMPLEXITY OF BFS IS V2..AND INSIDE LOOP WE ARE TRAVERSING ALL EDGEES ,SO ISNT IT BE E*(V^2) gourav pathak Yes, you are correct…but if you use adjacency list representation it will be O(E*max_flow) sumit well thanks for the article , but i think it would have been great if the article had discussed on what is augmenting paths first and then delved in Ford-Fulks ago . The alos it self is easy to understand if explained properly , unfortunately the materica journals above are cryptic , i rather say listen to the below video to understand the Algo and concept and code above for a completeness http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0wzih3_5Wo myk I tried using the graph from Sedgewick’s lecture from the link you provided, and it returns “25” for me, though “28” is expected. It seems “push-back” logic doesn’t work. The matrix I used: int[][] graph = { {0, 10, 5, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 15, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 6, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 15, 0, 10}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 15, 10}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} }; Can someone please verify this input on using the source provided in the article, as I used java? myk Found a mistake in my input graph. Output is as expected. http://code-away.tumblr.com/ Olayinka According to Wikipedia, this is Edmonds-Karp algorithm since you use a BFS. GeeksforGeeks Thanks for your inputs. We have updated the post. Appreciate your contribution. Nitin How can we be sure that BFS will select different path each time from source to sink? vijay because everytime when rGraph[u][v] -= path_flow; rGraph[v][u] += path_flow; executes, the graph changes atul why we are doing below code ?  
rGraph[v][u] += path_flow;
 Suppose there is path from u->v in original graph that does not mean that there could be any path from v->u , but we are updating value for path v->u .. I didn’t get this. please explain http://www.sudshekhar.blogspot.com sudhanshu Because we only consider edges with +ve weight, so one of v-u is definitely an edge. So we subtract path_flow from it. At the same time, adding path_flow to the reverse path [u-v](which may or may not exist), is to allow for the possibility of reverse flow. (i.e. this path would most prob not be used, and the loop where it is used will actually be nullifying the v-u flow and providing input from some other vertex) http://www.sudshekhar.blogspot.com sudhanshu also, adding to both sides, ensures that the flow entering the node is same as the one leaving it! #flow property Anonymous Can anyone please tell me how max flow of the above graph is coming 23. I was going through Introduction to Algorithm by cormen, and they have also taken the same example, but their max flow is coming 14 instead of 23 for the same graph. Please correct me If I am wrong. kartik Looks like you didn’t read the book carefully. See the final diagram in second column, there are two arcs with flow 19 and 4 toward t. xxmajia Below is a java version, 2 improvements 1) return true immediately, when BFS to t 2) dont need to maintain the “backward” edge, instead we use “Exhaustion” /* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */ public static boolean BFS(int[][] matrix, int[] parent, int s, int t) { // reinit parent for each BFS for (int i = 0; i < parent.length; i++) { parent[i] = -1; } boolean[] isVisited = new boolean[parent.length]; Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>(); queue.add(s); parent[s] = -1; isVisited[s] = true; while (!queue.isEmpty()) { int cur = queue.poll(); for (int i = 0; i < parent.length; i++) { if (!isVisited[i] && matrix[cur][i] > 0) { isVisited[i] = true; parent[i] = cur; // improvement 1 if (i == cur) { return true; } queue.add(i); } } } return isVisited[t]; } public static int maxFlow(int[][] graph, int s, int t) { int max = 0; int length = graph.length; int[][] matrix = new int[length][length]; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) { matrix[i][j] = graph[i][j]; } } int[] parent = new int[length]; while (BFS(matrix, parent, s, t)) { int flow = Integer.MAX_VALUE; int d = t; while (d != s) { flow = Math.min(flow, matrix[parent[d]][d]); d = parent[d]; } max += flow; // generate resigual matrix d = t; while (d != s) { matrix[parent[d]][d] -= flow; // improvement 2: //matrix[d][parent[d]] += flow; d = parent[d]; } } return max; } Viky Awesome Interview Experiences Advanced Data Structures Dynamic Programming Greedy Algorithms Backtracking Pattern Searching Divide & Conquer Mathematical Algorithms Recursion Geometric Algorithms Popular Posts All permutations of a given string Memory Layout of C Programs Understanding “extern” keyword in C Median of two sorted arrays Tree traversal without recursion and without stack!
