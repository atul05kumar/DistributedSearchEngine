Indian who joined ISIS returns, in NIA custody RELATED Indian who joined ISIS returns, in NIA custody First pictures: Indian youth who joined ISIS KALYAN: Arif Majeed, one of four youths from Kalyan who had gone to Iraq and is reported to have joined the Islamic State, returned to India on Friday morning and was being interrogated by the NIA. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) team reached Mumbai airport from Turkey at around 5.15am this morning with Arif. Arif had escaped to Turkey from Iraq. The NIA informed Arif's parents in Kalyan who have now gone to Mumbai to meet their son. READ ALSO: Kalyan youths fighting for ISIS want to return home Sources said that NIA which is investigating the case will first probe Arif on his role with the ISIS and later may allow him to go with his family. Arif's family was unavailable for comment but his relative Iftiqar Khan confirmed the development saying it was good news for the family that Arif had returned. Iftiqar wanted the law agency to allow the youth to return to his family after completing its probe as whatever he had done was " a mistake under the influence of extremists" and he should be given a chance to live a normal life. With Arif's return, parents of the others youth too are now hoping that their sons would come back. In May, four youths from Kalyan — Arif, Fahad Shaikh, Saheem Tanki and Amaan Tandel — went to Iraq to join the terror group ISIS. Later, however, they expressed a wish to be rescued and to return home. The four are said to have joined the ISIS in May this year after being radicalized and then flown to Iraq, along with a group of pilgrims. According to sources, 10-12 Indian youths are said to have been recruited by ISIS from India and abroad. Though the government has been maintaining that ISIS has no major impact on Indian Muslims, the fact that radicalization and recruitment by the terror outfit figures as a key agenda point for the DGP/IGP meet on November 29 and 30, indicates that the government is keen to nip in the bud any attempts by it to radicalize Indian youth.
