In tonight's episode, during the Judgment Day task, captain Puneet is asked to punish any two housemates as per his will. Puneet, after thinking for a while, states that Ali should be punished due to his inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour towards the other contestants. However Puneet nominates Upen and Gautam for punishment to make Ali feel guilty, who in turn gets upset with Puneet's decision. Puneet denies and says that he doesn't want Ali to be guilt free and punishes the two innocent and most hardworking contestants of the house. Ali loses his cool and starts arguing with Puneet. Soon the Punishment task turns into a bowl of fire as Puneet and Ali face-off spreads all around the house. As the blame game goes on from one to the other, Sonali slaps Ali when Puneet reveals that he had passed a very inappropriate comment about Upen and her a few days back. An agitated Ali runs all over the place along with his suitcase and even tries to climb the roof-top shouting out loud to Bigg Boss stating that Sonali has slapped him and he will not tolerate it. Bigg Boss then summons Ali into the confession room. Ali complains that he is not feeling well and what Sonali did to him was not right. Meanwhile, an upset Sonali is supported by all the housemates. Sonali states that she will not take Ali's non-sense anymore. Ali is soon shifted to a secret room due to his ill health and Bigg Boss informs the housemates about the same.  /bigg-boss-8-inmates-who-instigate-fights/eventshow/45296793.cms 01 Sonali slaps Ali for inappropriate comment: As we thought that the issue of Ali’s inappropriate behaviour towards Sonali is getting resolved, eventually the two have shocked us yet again when Sonali slapped Ali.

Renee, who is playing an important part in the current luxury budget task, refused to perform a task and as a result of this Karishma was not allowed to meet her mother who travelled all the way from Mumbai to meet her daughter. During the task, Karishma was given four options in the app task - fan reactions, meeting her mom, getting her make-up back and getting access to conversations that the contestants had behind her back. Karishma chose the option of meeting her mother, but as there was not enough battery, Bigg Boss gives Karishma a chance to convince Renee to complete the task of colouring her hair and recharge the house battery and get her to meet her mom. Sources inform, Karishma bursts into tears and also pleads to Renee to do the task. However, Renee turns down her request saying that when the housemates were given a chance to save one person from nominations, none of them chose to save. So why she would help anyone. Everyone tries to convince Renee, but everything goes in vain. In fact, at one point she gets up and even tears off her own father's picture. Everyone gets shocked at this behaviour of Renee. Karishma then decides that now she will not take Renee's help to meet her mother, she will be strong and says no, as Renee's behaviour was not acceptable. Renee didn't let Karishma meet her mother who travelled all the way from Mumbai to meet her daughter.  Bigg Boss 8: Inmates who instigate fights /bigg-boss-8-inmates-who-instigate-fights/eventshow/45217527.cms 03 Ali Quli Mirza, who entered the Bigg Boss house as a wild card entry grabbed eyeballs with his aggressive attitude as a captain. He had fights with the inmates regarding their daily chores. He also had a big argument with Diandra regarding a task. The singer is known for his short temper and has been an important player on Bigg Boss 8. The inmates of Bigg Boss 8 also call him a double dholki referring to him switching loyalties. Sonali, who was not comfortable with Ali's touch, got very upset with his behaviour and lashed out at him. She even literally kicked him on his chest and also warned him by saying that he will get slapped if he tries to repeat such an act.  Bigg Boss 8: Inmates who instigate fights /bigg-boss-8-inmates-who-instigate-fights/eventshow/45217541.cms 04 Karisma Tanna, who sought attention upon choosing make-up over her friend Sushant in one of the tasks too is known for her selfish attitude. She also had fights in the house and is known for instigating people against each other. She had a major showdown with Gautam Gulati. The actress has also been in news for her bonding with Puneet Issar. However, Karisma was seen bad-mouthing Puneet behind his back. She was seen instigating Pritam against Gautam after a fight between the two.  Bigg Boss 8: Inmates who instigate fights /bigg-boss-8-inmates-who-instigate-fights/eventshow/45217557.cms 05 Dimpy Mahajan: Dimpy Ganguly Mahajan, who entered Bigg Boss 8 a few days back has managed to get into the dirty politics of the house. Rahul's wife Dimpy entered the show as a wild card entry and has been accused of breaking the P3G group (Puneet Issar, Praneet, Pritam and Gautam) of the house.

However, the actor too had his share of ugly fights with the inmates. He was also thrown out of the house after he hit Arya. The actor is known for reportedly instigating fights on the show as many inmates term him to be the mastermind. Arya Babbar who was eliminated last week said that Puneet represents the dirt and murk of the society. "A distinctive characteristic of every person was highlighted on the show - sweet, self-obsessed, quarrelsome, dumb and hypocrite. Puneet Issar was obnoxious, cheap and dirty. He represents the dirt and murk of the society. He would call someone his son and daughter and then later talk bad behind their backs," Arya told PTI after his eviction from the show.  Bigg Boss 8: Inmates who instigate fights /bigg-boss-8-inmates-who-instigate-fights/eventshow/45217550.cms 07 Diandra, who is known for her straight forward attitude too has many times got into ugly fights. Her fight with Ali was one of the most talked about tiffs on the show. Her on and off rapport with Gautam too grabbed eyeballs. The model shares a great rapport with Karishma. In many tasks, Diandra has got aggressive and instigated the inmates. Soni Singh, who was part of Bigg Boss and got eliminated after few weeks in an interview with TOI said, "Diandra is a lovely girl. She is very mature and handles a situation or a task in a very intelligent manner. Yes, she was rather irritable at times. But so were all of us girls - ahead of those specific days in the month. I understand what made Diandra so chidchida. But, I'm really impressed with the fact that she created an amazing look for herself, using hair colour and simple pieces of clothes, even though her clothes and suitcase were not sent by Bigg Boss. I told her that my brother D Nirman, who is into film direction, would really like her. And I'd really love to have Diandra as my bhabhi someday. When I came out of the celebrity house, my brother told me that Diandra was his favourite contestant. I really admire that gal!"  Bigg Boss 8: Inmates who instigate fights /bigg-boss-8-inmates-who-instigate-fights/eventshow/45217548.cms 08 Sushant Divgikar: Sushant, who was friendly with all the contestants in the house was seen instigating people on the show. He was upset with Karishma after she chose make-up over her friendship and this sparked off such a reaction. In one of the interviews with TOI, Sushant expressed, "I'm a certified psychologist and I have spent enough time with each candidate inside to realise that many of them are putting up a show and a charade to garner cheap publicity. I'm glad that I'm out of the show and came out with my head held high."  Bigg Boss 8: Inmates who instigate fights 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 pagination.cms?msid=45215762&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
