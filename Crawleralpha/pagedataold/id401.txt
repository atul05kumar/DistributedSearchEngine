Together they have set records at the ticket window with 3 Idiots. If Eid and Diwali are dominated by Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, then Christmas is definitely Aamir's domian. The perfectionist prefers releasing his films during Christmas where his releases have struck gold at the box-office. This year the superstar has booked the festive season of Christmas for his film PK which stars Anushka Sharma opposite him. The film is scheduled to release on December 19 2014.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937490.cms 03 Though it's too soon to talk about 2015 as the new year is still to arrive, our Bollywood biggies seem to have their diary full in 2015-2016 as well. The box-office will continue to see some big releases from the big boys of Bollywood during the festive season of 2015-2016 as their films are lined up in advance for the coming two years. The box-office reports of films like Kick, Singham Returns and Bang Bang has proved that it's always sensible to release films on holidays or festivals. After 2014, let's take a look at the films releasing on holidays in 2015-2016.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937491.cms 04 Shah Rukh Khan's Fan: Both Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan have always been pitted against each other at the box-office and the trend will continue in 2015 too. And since there is no announcement from Aamir Khan's side for his next release after P. K, the competition will be between SRK-Salman as to who will score bigger. Shah Rukh Khan's Fan will also mark the comeback of the hit jodi of SRK and Aditya Chopra. Fan will be directed by Maneesh Sharma and is written by Habib Faisal. While Salman Khan and Shah Rukh khan have always eyed to capture the box-office during Eid for the past few years, for 2015, it will be SRK who will be seen on the silver screen.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937488.cms 05 Bajrangi Bhaijaan: Together, they broke all previous records at the ticket window with their film Ek Tha Tiger. From the fastest 100 crore film to crossing 200 crores, the producers laughed their way to the bank. Besides creating the record of the highest opening day ever with a Rs. 32.92 crore, the film also managed to break all opening weekend records. Now, this successful combination returns with Bajrangi Bhaijaan. The title of the film has already created a lot of curiosity amongst viewers. With Bajrangi Bhaijan, we will get to see the hit pair of Kareena Kapoor and Salman Khan whose last release Bodyguard was a smashing hit. In 2015, the Dabangg Khan has booked both EID and Diwali for his films which clearly indicates that the actor dominates the holiday season. But will all this work in the film's favour? Only time will tell.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937484.cms 06 Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo: All eyes are set on the Diwali release when two old friends will come together. Yes, we are talking about Salman Khan and Sooraj Barjatya who have together given hit films like Maine Pyaar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Saath Saath Hain. Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo will see Salman romancing Sonam Kapoor. The two were earlier seen together in Sonam's debut film Saawariya. With Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo we will also get to see many Salman-Sooraj moments that we have missed in the recent Salman Khan filmss. Also, in Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo, fans will get to see Salman Khan in a double role after his blockbuster Judwaa. Recently, while talking to the media, Salman had said that his role in Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo is the toughest, "It is very difficult for me to become that Prem once again. I am having all my films put together and this film separately, just to unlearn everything I have learnt so far," Salman said.

However, all eyes are on the last two months of this year as it has a great line up of films. The combination of Akshay and Neeraj Pandey has been lucky at the box-office and in 2015 they've chose Republic Day once again to repeat their success story. In his second venture with Neeraj, Akshay along with actors like Anupam Kher, Tanpasee Pannu will be seen doing some high octane action sequences which have been shot across foreign locations like Nepal, Istanbul (Turkey) and Abu Dhabi.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937480.cms 08 Bajirao Mastani: The dream cast of Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh will be seen once again in the epic drama Bajirao Mastani. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's last release Ram Leela with Deepika and Ranveer went on to create records at the box-office. Right from the acting to the direction, the music, every aspect of the film was appreciated. Ram Leela's lead pair literally sizzled on the screen with their chemistry and Sanjay Leela Bhansali seems to be in the mood to repeat the history. Keeping in mind the larger than life sets and films that SLB makes, there is no doubt that Bajirao Mastani will do justice to the festive mood of Christmas. The film is slated to release on Christmas (December 25 2015).  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937475.cms 09 Tamasha: After the super success of Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani, ex-flames Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone will be seen in Imtiaz Al's Tamasha. According to some reports, Ranbir Kapoor plays a free spirited person who wants everybody around him to be happy. He is a nomad, going out of his way to please people. Shooting of the film's first schedule began on July 9, 2014 in Corsica, France and was wrapped on July 30, 2014. Tamasha is being produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, who had a successful run at the box-office last year with back to back films like Kick, 2 States, Heropanti and Highway. The film will face tough competition as the Ranveer Singh-Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra starrer Bajirao Mastani also releases on the same day. As to who will benefit with the festival release, we will only have to wait and watch.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 /bollywood-superstars-book-all-festivals-till-2016/eventshow/44937474.cms 10 Shuddhi: Karan Johar's ambitious project Shuddhi, which is loosely based on the novel Immortals of Melluha, has faced several raodblocks. The film which was initially supposed to be made with Hrithik Roshan, saw several changes until it fell in Dabangg Khan Salman's lap. Salman, whose calendar seems to be full till 2016, is expected to have some big releases in the next two years. Shuddhi is Salman's first full-fleged film with Karan Johar. Both Salman and Karan have shown interest in working with each other in the past and with Shuddhi their long awaiting wish finally comes true. Salman's last few releases have done extra ordinary business at the box-office and as a result Shuddhi will also be released on a festival day. The movie is expected to release during Diwali 2016.  Bollywood superstars book all festivals till 2016 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 pagination.cms?msid=44937471&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
