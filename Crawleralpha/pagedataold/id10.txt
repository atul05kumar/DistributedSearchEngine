Silent why is it not giving any error.. we are not allocating any memory to the integer pointer still it is giving the result.. why?? #include #include int* fun(int *ptr) { *ptr=100; return ptr; } int main() { int num = 50; int *pp = fun(pp); printf(“%d,%d”,num,*pp); getch(); return 0; } Abhimanyu It gives run time error(segmentation fault) in GCC compiler, as expected.

 Nick Why op of this 2 program is different? P1: float a=2,*f1,*f2; f1=f2=&a; *f1+=(a+=2.5); printf(“\n%f %f %f”,a,*f1,*f2); P2: float a=2,*f1,*f2; f1=f2=&a; a+=(a+=2.5); printf(“\n%f %f %f”,a,*f1,*f2); Abhimanyu Key thing here is the operator precedence. Operator precedence of *(indirection or pointer) is higher than that of +(arithmetic addition). So in expression *f1 = *f1 + (a +2.5)…*f1 will be evaluated 1st which is having value 2 and it will be added to 4.5(a+2.5) and result will be stored in &a (that is pointed by f1 and f2) In the second one result is as you expect it to be.  
/* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
 Nitish Kumar Maharana P1 :-> ans *f1 += ( a += 2.5 ); => *f1 = *f1 + ( a = a + 2.5 ) => *f1 = 2 + ( a = 2 + 2.5 ) ( here *f1 = 2, a = 2 given ) => *f1 = 2 + 4.5 => *f1 = 6.5 P2 :-> ans a += ( a += 2.5 ); => a = a + ( a = a + 2.5 ) => a = a + ( a = 2 + 2.5 ) ( given a = 2 ) => a = a + 4.5 => a = 4.5 + 4.5 ( given a = 4.5 ) => a = 8.5 Asap Can anyone explain op of this int i=5; printf(“%d%d%d%d%d%d”,i++,i–,++i,–i,i); i m getting 4 5 5 5 5 lok start from right to left. i=5.so 5 wil be printed. –i->i wil be decremented first.so i=4 and it wil be printed.now ++i->i wil be incremented first.so i=5 and it wil be printed.now i– implies 5 wil be printed first and it wil be decremented later.so i=4 now.i++ means i=4 wil be printed and i wil be incremented later.so i=5 finally and output will be 45545 Asap Yeah i also thought that the op should be 45545 But if i execute it,i get 45555  
/* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
 Utpal Sharma Output of the code above is “compiler dependent”.Here use of ++ and — is not within an arithmetic expression and is done on the same operand,i.e,the output values depend on the “order of evaluation of arguments” which cannot be predicted and hence the output will vary for different compilers. sachin katiyar The answer of this que is: since this program is run under c language not under c++, therefore pre-increment or pre-decrement will not work in it. this is the drawback of c language which is modified in c++. only post-increment/post-decrement will work in it. therefore moving from right to left, it print 5 until 4th position and then decrement 1 due to i– (at fouth position) and print it at fifth position. therefore answer is 55554. ultimate_coder  
Undefined behaviour ! ! !
 ultimate_coder As far as i know this comes under undefined behaviour and the order of evaluation of function arguements is compiler dependent. So any output of your program is acceptable. anil when u r working with this type of que. printf will work on stack and solve it right to left direction . as #include #include int main() { int num,num1,dg,oct,p; printf(“enter the num\n”); scanf(“%d”,&num); num1=num; p=oct=0; while(num>0) { dg=num%8; num=num/8; oct=oct+dg*pow(10,p); p++; } printf(“num1%d=octal%d\n”,num1,oct); return 0; }
