Article Data History Submitted: 09  August  1978 Accepted: 11 September 1979 Published online: 13 July 2006 Keywordsalgorithm, Boolean circuit complexity, divide-and-conquer, graph embedding, lower bounds, matching, maximum independent set, nonserial dynamic programming, pebbling, planar graphs, separator, space-time tradeoffs Publication Data ISSN (print): 0097-5397 ISSN (online): 1095-7111 Publisher: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics CODEN: smjcat Richard J. Lipton and Robert Endre Tarjan DOI:10.1137/0209046 Any n-vertex planar graph has the property that it can be divided into components of roughly equal size by removing only $O(\sqrt n )$ vertices. This separator theorem, in combination with a divide-and-conquer strategy, leads to many new complexity results for planar graph problems. This paper describes some of these results.
