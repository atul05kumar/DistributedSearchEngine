 Doug There is a great book : “Top 10 coding interview problems asked in Google with solutions: Algorithmic Approach” which claims to just focus on google questions, though it helped me greatly in Amazon onsite interviews recently. My friends are saying that almost all technical questions asked @Google onsite interviews are from these books: http://www.amazon.com/coding-interview-problems-Google-solutions/dp/1482799014 http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Questions-Solutions/dp/1479274836/ RAKESH AGARWAL Complete reference of c,complete reference of c++ by Herbert Schildt kishore hi guys…. could any 1 plz give the examples for using command ‘grep’ in unix. Shans Traps and Pitfalls in C by Andrew Koenig is an awesome book for C interview preparation …

 http://programmingtrails.wordpress.com Ravi Chandra How to program series on C/C++/Java are also good books. http://www.amazon.com/C-How-Program-6th-Edition/dp/0136152503 teja DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS MADE EASY BY NARASIMHA KARUMANCHI is worth mentioning here.

 Download head first all books http://it-ebooks.info/search/?q=head+first&type=title pr6989 C in depth by S.K.Srivastava and Deepali Srivastava is a very good book for understanding basics of C. It has good explanations in a very easy to read fashion. Venki I don’t prefer any other book other than K&R on C. I agree in the first read it may be little difficult to get all concepts. Many of C programmers read other books for interview tricks. Rather I would encourage reader to focus on learning core fundamentals of the language by referring legacy code or some existing projects. A beginner can start with the book “Programming with C by Byron Gottfried”, them move to K&R. avani I agree. K&R is best for C. The supplementary notes for the book ensure a thorough reading. You can get them here: http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/krnotes/top.html

 avani Solutions to The C programming book: http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions suresh Data structures through C depth by s.k.srivasava deepali srivastava is also good book Nikhil “Let us C” and “Let Us C++” by yashwant kanetkar are good to start with. After understanding basic things it will be easier to follow standard books. Vikrant Perhaps, we may add some books on Design patterns and designing using OOP.

 GeeksforGeeks Thanks for the suggestion. We have created a category for design pattern and added 3 books to it. rahul Algorithms Design by John Kleinberg and eva tardos. http://www.flipkart.com/algorithm-design-813170310x/p/itmdytssuhy5breh?pid=9788131703106&ref=e8c6e593-8484-4fb3-8edd-5add271f0ef4&srno=m_1_1&otracker=from-search GeeksforGeeks Thanks! Added to the list. Arpit http://www.4shared.com/office/Prrp_ofQ/DonaldEKnuthTheArtofComputerPr.html Art of computer programming by Donald E. Knuth. have a look. GeeksforGeeks Thanks! Added to the list http://www.4shared.com/office/Prrp_ofQ/DonaldEKnuthTheArtofComputerPr.html Arpit A good book for beginner. senior_pimiento What about SICP? GeeksforGeeks Thanks for suggesting the book. We have added it to the list. Kapil Algorithms- Programming Pearls http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Edition-Bentley/dp/0201657880 GeeksforGeeks Thanks for suggesting the book. We have added it to the list. VIKRAM I think DATA STRUCTURES USING C BY PADMAREDDY, is a very useful book written in a very simple language and covers all topics in a very lucid language. Its just a suggestion to include because my personal feeling is anyone starting with Data structures or people afraid of Data Structures should read this book. Cheers!
