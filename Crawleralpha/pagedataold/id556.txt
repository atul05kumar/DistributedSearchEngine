When the domain is Boolean (i.e. restricted to {0,1}), the maximum solution problem is identical to the well-studied Max Ones problem, and the complexity and approximability is completely understood for all restrictions on the underlying constraints. We continue this line of research by considering the Max Sol problem for relations defined by regular signed logic over finite subsets of the natural numbers; the complexity of the corresponding decision problem has recently been classified by Creignou et al. (Theory Comput. Syst. 42(2):239–255, 2008). We give sufficient conditions for when such problems are polynomial-time solvable and we prove that they are APX-hard otherwise. Similar dichotomies are also obtained for variants of the Max Sol problem.
