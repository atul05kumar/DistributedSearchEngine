The technical contribution of our paper is to introduce “ℓ 2 2 spreading metrics” (that can be computed by semidefinite programming) as relaxations for both undirected and directed “permutation metrics,” which are induced by permutations of {1,2,…,n}. The techniques introduced in the recent work of Arora, Rao and Vazirani (Proc. of 36th STOC, pp. 222–231, 2004) can be adapted to exploit the geometry of such ℓ 2 2 spreading metrics, giving a powerful tool for the design of divide-and-conquer algorithms. In addition to their applications to approximation algorithms, the study of such ℓ 2 2 spreading metrics as relaxations of permutation metrics is interesting in its own right. We show how our results imply that, in a certain sense we make precise, ℓ 2 2 spreading metrics approximate permutation metrics on n points to a factor of \(O(\sqrt{\log n}\log\log n)\) . A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the 17th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA ’06).
