Multiply a given Integer with 3.5  - GeeksforGeeks GeeksforGeeks A computer science portal for geeks GeeksQuiz Login Home Algorithms DS GATE Interview Corner Q&A C C++ Java Books Contribute Ask a Q About Array Bit Magic C/C++ Articles GFacts Linked List MCQ Misc Output String Tree Graph Multiply a given Integer with 3.5 Given a integer x, write a function that multiplies x with 3.5 and returns the integer result. You are not allowed to use %, /, *. Examples: Input: 2 Output: 7 Input: 5 Output: 17 (Ignore the digits after decimal point) Solution: 1. We can get x*3.5 by adding 2*x, x and x/2. To calculate 2*x, left shift x by 1 and to calculate x/2, right shift x by 2. 
#include <stdio.h>

int multiplyWith3Point5(int x)
{
  return (x<<1) + x + (x>>1);
}    

/* Driver program to test above functions*/
int main()
{
  int x = 4; 
  printf("%d", multiplyWith3Point5(x));
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
 2. Another way of doing this could be (8*x – x)/2 (See below code). Thanks to ajaym for suggesting this. 
#include <stdio.h>
int multiplyWith3Point5(int x)
{
  return ((x<<3) - x)>>1;
}

 kirt return n<>1)|1) anan return n<<<>>>1)|1) Kirt Sry, The shift operator are not displayed properly .. so here is d logic.. (right shift the ‘n’ by 2 bit )-(left shift the ‘n’ by 1 bit and take it OR with 1) plz correct me if i am wrong Kirt sry guys.. a lot of confusion over here.. (left shift the ‘n’ by 2 bit )-(right shift the ‘n’ by 1 bit and take it OR with 1) Anand simple we can do: return ((x<>1)); Anand (x<>1) Amit Why are we not doing this way int multi3_5(int x) { x*3.5; } hari6988 the question clearly says that u are not allowed to use * operator Nick we can do it without using + and – operator….. here’s the code  
int add(int m, int n);
int main()
{
        int n,d,e,f;
        scanf("%d",&n);
        d=n<>1;
        f=add(d,e);
        printf("%d\n",add(f,n));
        return 0;
}
int add(int m,int n)
{
        int c;
        while(m&n)
        {
                c=m&n;
                n^=m;
                c<<=1;
                m=c;
        }
        n^=m;
        return n;
}
 wav return (n>>3 -n)>>1; http://opninfo.worpress.com hariom Any way to print the output including digits after decimal point ? Venki Explore IEEE 754 floating point format. padhu can also be done by 4x-x/2 Shekhu This approach gives 18 for x = 5, but the expected output is 17 Prem Hey, look at the problem statement dude, you cant use ‘/’ Venki Hi Prem, They are not using / operator. They are trying to represent 3.5 as an expression in terms of powers of 2. So that, the expression can be implemented as shift operations. Ravi Chandra (4x-x)/2 can be implemented as follows without using * and / x= ((x<>1; Ravi Chandra Sorry!,in my previous comment shift operators did not appear properly… here is the line of code x= ((x<<2)-x)>>1; ravikant Dude common you have a year to go !! kirt n<>1)|1)

 ajaym Can also be achieved by (8x-x)/2 GeeksforGeeks @ajaym: Thanks for suggesting a new method. We have included it to the original post. Keep it up!!
