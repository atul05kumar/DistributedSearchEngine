David Eppstein David Eppstein About Contact Research Students Classes Software Math Fun I am a Chancellor's Professor in the Computer Science Department, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine. My research (see selected publications) has covered many topics in computational geometry and graph algorithms, including: Graph drawing and information visualization Dynamic graph algorithms and dynamic closest pair data structures Mesh generation and optimal triangulation K-shortest paths and related combinatorial enumeration algorithms Subgraph isomorphism and network statistics Data depth and robust statistics Exponential-time algorithms for NP-hard problems Distance-preserving embeddings of graphs and metric spaces I am also an avid photographer and have many photos in my web photo gallery. This site is quite static; if you want more frequent updates (or to find out what's changed here) go to my livejournal. My name is not uncommon (although the spelling is atypical); see my page of Eppsteins on the net if you think you've reached the wrong me.
