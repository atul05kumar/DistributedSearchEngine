Find k closest elements to a given value - GeeksforGeeks GeeksforGeeks A computer science portal for geeks GeeksQuiz Login Home Algorithms DS GATE Interview Corner Q&A C C++ Java Books Contribute Ask a Q About Array Bit Magic C/C++ Articles GFacts Linked List MCQ Misc Output String Tree Graph Find k closest elements to a given value Given a sorted array arr[] and a value X, find the k closest elements to X in arr[]. Examples: 
Input: K = 4, X = 35
       arr[] = {12, 16, 22, 30, 35, 39, 42, 
               45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56}
Output: 30 39 42 45
 Note that if the element is present in array, then it should not be in output, only the other closest elements are required. In the following solutions, it is assumed that all elements of array are distinct. A simple solution is to do linear search for k closest elements. 1) Start from the first element and search for the crossover point (The point before which elements are smaller than or equal to X and after which elements are greater). This step takes O(n) time. 2) Once we find the crossover point, we can compare elements on both sides of crossover point to print k closest elements. This step takes O(k) time. The time complexity of the above solution is O(n). An Optimized Solution is to find k elements in O(Logn + k) time. The idea is to use Binary Search to find the crossover point. Once we find index of crossover point, we can print k closest elements in O(k) time. 
#include<stdio.h>

/* Function to find the cross over point (the point before
   which elements are smaller than or equal to x and after
   which greater than x)*/
int findCrossOver(int arr[], int low, int high, int x)
{
  // Base cases
  if (arr[high] <= x) // x is greater than all
    return high;
  if (arr[low] > x)  // x is smaller than all
    return low;

  // Find the middle point
  int mid = (low + high)/2;  /* low + (high - low)/2 */

  /* If x is same as middle element, then return mid */
  if (arr[mid] <= x && arr[mid+1] > x)
    return mid;

  /* If x is greater than arr[mid], then either arr[mid + 1]
    is ceiling of x or ceiling lies in arr[mid+1...high] */
  if(arr[mid] < x)
      return findCrossOver(arr, mid+1, high, x);

  return findCrossOver(arr, low, mid - 1, x);
}

// This function prints k closest elements to x in arr[].
// n is the number of elements in arr[]
void printKclosest(int arr[], int x, int k, int n)
{
    // Find the crossover point
    int l = findCrossOver(arr, 0, n-1, x); // le
    int r = l+1;   // Right index to search
    int count = 0; // To keep track of count of elements already printed

    // If x is present in arr[], then reduce left index
    // Assumption: all elements in arr[] are distinct
    if (arr[l] == x) l--;

    // Compare elements on left and right of crossover
    // point to find the k closest elements
    while (l >= 0 && r < n && count < k)
    {
        if (x - arr[l] < arr[r] - x)
            printf("%d ", arr[l--]);
        else
            printf("%d ", arr[r++]);
        count++;
    }

    // If there are no more elements on right side, then
    // print left elements
    while (count < k && l >= 0)
        printf("%d ", arr[l--]), count++;

    // If there are no more elements on left side, then
    // print right elements
    while (count < k && r < n)
        printf("%d ", arr[r++]), count++;
}

/* Driver program to check above functions */
int main()
{
   int arr[] ={12, 16, 22, 30, 35, 39, 42,
               45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56};
   int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
   int x = 35, k = 4;
   printKclosest(arr, x, 4, n);
   return 0;
}
 Output: 39 30 42 45 The time complexity of this method is O(Logn + k). Exercise: Extend the optimized solution to work for duplicates also, i.e., to work for arrays where elements don’t have to be distinct. This article is contributed by Rahul Jain.
