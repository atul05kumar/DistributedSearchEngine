Dupont has once again launched its annual limited edition pen collection comprising 515 pieces of ball point and fountain pens.    Make and Finish Each fountain pen and roller ball pen in the collection is delicately engraved with the royal ceremonial armours worn by knights during the Renaissance period. Staying true to the knights theme, a decorative helmet glorifies the pen.   In recognition of being master lacquerers, fine hand guilding adorns each of them. The pen clip is studded with gorgeous flamboyant rubies and black jasper.   Strength and Beauty The collection is crafted to perfection, based on the theme of knights. The pens are bold and make a powerful impact.   Reminiscent of the strong armour worn by knights, this pen collection is definitely mightier than the sword.     Available at S.T. Dupont Boutique, Ambience Mall, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi; Price on Request   More On >> Pens Pin It Tweet TAGS: ST Dupont, limited edition, pens YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE The Droolworthy Gift List for Lacoste’s 80th Montblanc’s Meisterstuck Anniversary Collection Montegrappa Calls in the Doctor for its New Limited Edition Brain Pen Visconti’s Gold Limited Edition Pays Tribute to...
