JOHN IACONO Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn NY 11201, USAWOLFGANG MULZER Institut für Informatik, Freie Universität Berlin, Takustr. 9, 14195 Berlin, Germany Received: 24 August 2011 Revised: 9 March 2012 Over the last decade, there have been several data structures that, given a planar subdivision and a probability distribution over the plane, provide a way for answering point location queries that is fine-tuned for the distribution. All these methods suffer from the requirement that the query distribution must be known in advance. We present a new data structure for point location queries in planar triangulations. Our structure is asymptotically as fast as the optimal structures, but it requires no prior information about the queries. This is a 2-D analogue of the jump from Knuth's optimum binary search trees (discovered in 1971) to the splay trees of Sleator and Tarjan in 1985. While the former need to know the query distribution, the latter are statically optimal. This means that we can adapt to the query sequence and achieve the same asymptotic performance as an optimum static structure, without needing any additional information.
