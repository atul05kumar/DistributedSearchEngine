Please use ideone.com and share the link here. http://atiqwhiz.blogspot.in/ atiq No. of Binary trees(it can be structurally similar and different) out of N nodes is= N!*Catalan(N) Kong It should be (2n)!/((n+1)!*n!) because above expression will evaluate to ((2n)!/(n+1)!)*n! , correct me if i’m wrong GeeksforGeeks @All: The above fact is correct. The number of possible Binary Search Trees with n different keys is Catalan number only. Number of structurally different binary trees is also a catalan numbers. They both are different types of questions, but their result is same. In first, we are given n different keys and we want to know the number of ways we can organize them to form a BST. Let us take few examples. keys[] = {1, 2, 3}, we can organize them in 5 ways: two trees with 1 as root + 1 tree with 2 as root + 2 trees with 3 as root. Take more examples, and you will see pattern of catalan numbers. See question 2 of this for more details. In second, we want to know structurally different trees with n nodes, we are not given keys. For n = 3, there can be 5 trees. The expression for this will be same as the expression for BST provided here aspire Can you please explain the difference between nodes and keys? Asap I think its binary tree http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/binarytrees/ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3042412/with-n-no-of-nodes-how-many-different-binary-and-binary-search-trees-possib http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~saha/ subhasish It is number if Binary trees not Binary *Search* Trees http://shashank7s.blogspot.com wgpshashank hi , please update the post that Cn will number of fully binary trees not simple BT or BST .
