The two apparently started dating when they participated in a cricket reality show. But according to a report in Hindustan Times, the duo seemed to have spilled the beans. The report states that in a promo for a series slated to go on air this year, Karan refers to Kamya as his girlfriend. A source is quoted in the report as saying that in the promo when Kamya complains to Karan that the bowler from a rival team is eyeing her, Karan retorts by saying that how dare someone hit on his girlfriend. However, though this seems to be an admittance of sorts, it isn't really coming out in public with a confession. The duo are often clicked together in public but have never accepted their relationship status. While celebs mostly prefer to stay tight-lipped when it comes to discussing their love-life, Mohit and Mouni's apparent decision to admit to their relationship comes as a breath of fresh air. Here are other TV stars whom we would love to see admitting to their relationships.  /5-rumored-celebs-of-tv-who-should-confess-their-love-this-valentines/TV-celebs-who-should-admit-to-their-relationship-status/eventshow/45297620.cms 01 Rumoured to be dating since last year, TV actors Karan Patel and Kamya Punjabi have never publicly admitted to their relationship.

Since Anas and Rati have never worked together on any show, it was very difficult for the fans to believe it when the news about the couple started doing the rounds. But as they say, there's no smoke without fire. News of them dating soon gained momentum. Though both the actors denied dating each other, gossip-mills continue to churn out stories about their proximity. It was also reported that the reason behind their relationship being a secret is that they belong to different religions. And Anas' confession that he can never marry an actress makes their relationship more complicated. We sure do hope that they find a middle ground and come out in the open about their relationship.  TV celebs who should admit to their relationship status 01 02 03 04 05 pagination.cms?msid=30275174&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
