This problem arises in a number of applications. For example, in air-traffic control, you may want to monitor planes that come too close together, since this may indicate a possible collision. Recall the following formula for distance between two points p and q. The Brute force solution is O(n^2), compute the distance between each pair and return the smallest. We can calculate the smallest distance in O(nLogn) time using Divide and Conquer strategy. In this post, a O(n x (Logn)^2) approach is discussed. We will be discussing a O(nLogn) approach in a separate post. Algorithm Following are the detailed steps of a O(n (Logn)^2) algortihm. Input: An array of n points P[] Output: The smallest distance between two points in the given array. As a pre-processing step, input array is sorted according to x coordinates. 1) Find the middle point in the sorted array, we can take P[n/2] as middle point. 2) Divide the given array in two halves. The first subarray contains points from P[0] to P[n/2]. The second subarray contains points from P[n/2+1] to P[n-1]. 3) Recursively find the smallest distances in both subarrays. Let the distances be dl and dr. Find the minimum of dl and dr. Let the minimum be d. 4) From above 3 steps, we have an upper bound d of minimum distance. Now we need to consider the pairs such that one point in pair is from left half and other is from right half. Consider the vertical line passing through passing through P[n/2] and find all points whose x coordinate is closer than d to the middle vertical line. Build an array strip[] of all such points. 5) Sort the array strip[] according to y coordinates. This step is O(nLogn). It can be optimized to O(n) by recursively sorting and merging. 6) Find the smallest distance in strip[]. This is tricky. From first look, it seems to be a O(n^2) step, but it is actually O(n). It can be proved geometrically that for every point in strip, we only need to check at most 7 points after it (note that strip is sorted according to Y coordinate). See this for more analysis. 7) Finally return the minimum of d and distance calculated in above step (step 6) Implementation Following is C/C++ implementation of the above algorithm.

// given set of points.

};

/* Following two functions are needed for library function qsort().

// Needed to sort array of points according to X coordinate
int compareX(const void* a, const void* b)
{
    Point *p1 = (Point *)a,  *p2 = (Point *)b;
    return (p1->x - p2->x);
}
// Needed to sort array of points according to Y coordinate
int compareY(const void* a, const void* b)
{
    Point *p1 = (Point *)a,   *p2 = (Point *)b;
    return (p1->y - p2->y);
}

// A utility function to find the distance between two points
float dist(Point p1, Point p2)
{
    return sqrt( (p1.x - p2.x)*(p1.x - p2.x) +
                 (p1.y - p2.y)*(p1.y - p2.y)
               );
}

// A Brute Force method to return the smallest distance between two points
// in P[] of size n

{
    float min = FLT_MAX;

        for (int j = i+1; j < n; ++j)
            if (dist(P[i], P[j]) < min)
                min = dist(P[i], P[j]);
    return min;
}

// A utility function to find minimum of two float values
float min(float x, float y)
{
    return (x < y)? x : y;
}


// A utility function to find the distance beween the closest points of

// method as the inner loop runs at most 6 times
float stripClosest(Point strip[], int size, float d)
{
    float min = d;  // Initialize the minimum distance as d

    qsort(strip, size, sizeof(Point), compareY); 

    // Pick all points one by one and try the next points till the difference
    // between y coordinates is smaller than d.
    // This is a proven fact that this loop runs at most 6 times
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        for (int j = i+1; j < size && (strip[j].y - strip[i].y) < min; ++j)
            if (dist(strip[i],strip[j]) < min)
                min = dist(strip[i], strip[j]);

    return min;
}

// A recursive function to find the smallest distance. The array P contains
// all points sorted according to x coordinate
float closestUtil(Point P[], int n)
{
    // If there are 2 or 3 points, then use brute force
    if (n <= 3)
        return bruteForce(P, n);

    // Find the middle point
    int mid = n/2;
    Point midPoint = P[mid];

    // Consider the vertical line passing through the middle point
    // calculate the smallest distance dl on left of middle point and
    // dr on right side
    float dl = closestUtil(P, mid);
    float dr = closestUtil(P + mid, n-mid);

    // Find the smaller of two distances
    float d = min(dl, dr);

    // Build an array strip[] that contains points close (closer than d)
    // to the line passing through the middle point
    Point strip[n];
    int j = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (abs(P[i].x - midPoint.x) < d)
            strip[j] = P[i], j++;

    // Find the closest points in strip.  Return the minimum of d and closest
    // distance is strip[]
    return min(d, stripClosest(strip, j, d) );
}

// The main functin that finds the smallest distance
// This method mainly uses closestUtil()
float closest(Point P[], int n)
{
    qsort(P, n, sizeof(Point), compareX);

    // Use recursive function closestUtil() to find the smallest distance
    return closestUtil(P, n);
}

// Driver program to test above functions
int main()
{
    Point P[] = {{2, 3}, {12, 30}, {40, 50}, {5, 1}, {12, 10}, {3, 4}};
    int n = sizeof(P) / sizeof(P[0]);
    printf("The smallest distance is %f ", closest(P, n));
    return 0;
}
 Output: The smallest distance is 1.414214 Time Complexity Let Time complexity of above algorithm be T(n). Let us assume that we use a O(nLogn) sorting algorithm. The above algorithm divides all points in two sets and recursively calls for two sets. After dividing, it finds the strip in O(n) time, sorts the strip in O(nLogn) time and finally finds the closest points in strip in O(n) time. So T(n) can expressed as follows T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) + O(nLogn) + O(n) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(nLogn) T(n) = T(n x Logn x Logn) Notes 1) Time complexity can be improved to O(nLogn) by optimizing step 5 of the above algorithm. We will soon be discussing the optimized solution in a separate post. 2) The code finds smallest distance. It can be easily modified to find the points with smallest distance. 3) The code uses quick sort which can be O(n^2) in worst case. To have the upper bound as O(n (Logn)^2), a O(nLogn) sorting algorithm like merge sort or heap sort can be used References: http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2013/cmsc451/Lects/lect10.pdf http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS4Zn1a9KUc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T7T8Ym20M http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem           Related Topics: Job Sequencing Problem | Set 1 (Greedy Algorithm) Multiply two polynomials Algorithm Practice Question for Beginners | Set 1 Count Distinct Non-Negative Integer Pairs (x, y) that Satisfy the Inequality x*x + y*y < n Binomial Heap Print all increasing sequences of length k from first n natural numbers Find n’th number in a number system with only 3 and 4 Minimum Cost Polygon Triangulation Tags: Closest Pair of Points, Divide and Conquer Tweet Writing code in comment? Please use ideone.com and share the link here. Serif Is the theme of this article intended to be divide and conquer algorithms in general of just an O(n log n) solution to the closest pair problem? If the latter, then wouldn’t a trailing edge algorithm provide a much simpler solution? (Not sure how to embed ideone scripts here.) shiva How come the time complexity for brute force is O(n^2) …it should be O(n!) right? Josh In that method all distances (binary relations) between all points are computed … ~ C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2 Guest rem45acp I really truly wish this could have been implemented in such a way that it calculates what two Points are the closest, not the distance between them. It’s is proving extremely difficult to modify it so that it can do this. The title even says Closest Pair of Points. annonymoe why difficult.. whenever you update the closest distance keep a global variable to track those two points Yash What if I partition the space in such a way that 1 partition has n/4 points and second one has 3n/4 points. Then too the complexity will remain O(nlogn). What if first partition has sqRoot(n) then what. rohan Do we need to sort y cordinates?…as we are passing it again so i dnt think its will be required to sort it …plz clarify? sakshi chourasia hi, I have a doubt in algorithm. In line 3 of algo we goes on recursively dividing and finding dl and dr and then d=min(dl,dr) but there is also possibility of existence of dlr so in every recursive call we should also find dl,dr,dlr and then d should be min(dl,dr,dlr). Anupam The link for the proof of 6th point is broken. Please fix it! GeeksforGeeks Thanks for pointing this out. We have changed the link. knownAnonymous I am not getting he concept of 7 points. Please elaborate. Mike It’s been a while since you wrote this, but I really want to thank you for writing this, it’s the ONLY article that actually made me understand this algorithm. Other sources fail to explain or even mention the O(n * log n * log n) complexity, they just blatantly lie and say it’s O(n * log n). Thank you very very much. P.S. Not sure where can I find the O(n * log n) post here (?), although I think I know how to do it (pass the y-sorted arrays and merge them instead of sorting again) http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/closest-pair-of-points/ LAKHAN SINGH MEENA #include #include #include #include // A structure to represent a Point in 2D plane struct Point { int x, y; }; /* Following two functions are needed for library function qsort().
