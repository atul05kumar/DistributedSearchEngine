As a director, it’s my right to explore different things.” Three years after that dismissal, Farhan is returning to direction and the genre with the third part of the Don franchise. And SRK will again lead the cast. Confirming this, Farhan’s business partner, Ritesh Sidhwani said:“How can I do Don without Don? SRK is Don and Don is SRK.”The film has been in the works for some time and buzz is that Farhan, Ritesh and their team have already completed almost 50 per cent of the script. Mirror has it that the actor had several meetings with Farhan and Ritesh during a short break after the release of Chennai Express in 2013. He has since met the duo several more times to fine tune the modalities of for the third instalment of the commercially successful franchise. However the film’s leading lady has not yet been cast.
