 tejas Hello, Thanks for wonderful problems and their solutions explained in systematic way. A suggestion is to add the tag for “Greedy Programming”. It would be helpful for all the problems in that design pattern like others. Thank you. deepak Thanks for the amazing articles. I would request you to cover some Design Pattern topics as well. That would be of great help. Thanks & keep up the good work.

 alien HI Geeksforgeeks, I also think that design patterns would very helpful. gautam Hi, I would like to suggest that, please add a new tabs called “references”, where you can put all the references (docs, links etc). Currently references has been mentioned at the end of problems, but some time we want to explore further in references. This is just a suggestion and I think this will help students and other geeks to like this site more. Regards, Gautam
