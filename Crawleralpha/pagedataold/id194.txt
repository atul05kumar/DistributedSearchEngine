Demaine, David Eppstein (Submitted on 23 Aug 2000 (v1), last revised 27 Jul 2001 (this version, v2)) Abstract: We show that, in John Conway's board game Phutball (or Philosopher's Football), it is NP-complete to determine whether the current player has a move that immediately wins the game. In contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man, are both solvable in polynomial time.
