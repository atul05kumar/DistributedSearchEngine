While Kylie Jenner looked sizzling hot in wine gown with a deep, wide neckline reaching her waist, Kate Beckinsale looked equally glamorous in a white outfit with a long plunging neckline. The one who stood out among the hotties was Rita Ora with a protruding off-shoulder dress in bright yellow.  American Music Awards 2014: Hottest glimpses from the night 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 pagination.cms?msid=45258120&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
