Median in a stream of integers (running integers) - GeeksforGeeks GeeksforGeeks A computer science portal for geeks GeeksQuiz Login Home Algorithms DS GATE Interview Corner Q&A C C++ Java Books Contribute Ask a Q About Array Bit Magic C/C++ Articles GFacts Linked List MCQ Misc Output String Tree Graph Median in a stream of integers (running integers) Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in efficient way. For simplicity assume there are no duplicates. For example, let us consider the stream 5, 15, 1, 3 … After reading 1st element of stream - 5 -> median - 5
After reading 2nd element of stream - 5, 15 -> median - 10
After reading 3rd element of stream - 5, 15, 1 -> median - 5
After reading 4th element of stream - 5, 15, 1, 3 -> median - 4, so on... Making it clear, when the input size is odd, we take the middle element of sorted data. If the input size is even, we pick average of middle two elements in sorted stream. Note that output is effective median of integers read from the stream so far. Such an algorithm is called online algorithm. Any algorithm that can guarantee output of i-elements after processing i-th element, is said to be online algorithm. Let us discuss three solutions for the above problem. Method 1: Insertion Sort If we can sort the data as it appears, we can easily locate median element. Insertion Sort is one such online algorithm that sorts the data appeared so far. At any instance of sorting, say after sorting i-th element, the first i elements of array are sorted. The insertion sort doesn’t depend on future data to sort data input till that point. In other words, insertion sort considers data sorted so far while inserting next element. This is the key part of insertion sort that makes it an online algorithm. However, insertion sort takes O(n2) time to sort n elements. Perhaps we can use binary search on insertion sort to find location of next element in O(log n) time. Yet, we can’t do data movement in O(log n) time. No matter how efficient the implementation is, it takes polynomial time in case of insertion sort. Interested reader can try implementation of Method 1. Method 2: Augmented self balanced binary search tree (AVL, RB, etc…) At every node of BST, maintain number of elements in the subtree rooted at that node. We can use a node as root of simple binary tree, whose left child is self balancing BST with elements less than root and right child is self balancing BST with elements greater than root. The root element always holds effective median. If left and right subtrees contain same number of elements, root node holds average of left and right subtree root data. Otherwise, root contains same data as the root of subtree which is having more elements. After processing an incoming element, the left and right subtrees (BST) are differed utmost by 1. Self balancing BST is costly in managing balancing factor of BST. However, they provide sorted data which we don’t need. We need median only. The next method make use of Heaps to trace median. Method 3: Heaps Similar to balancing BST in Method 2 above, we can use a max heap on left side to represent elements that are less than effective median, and a min heap on right side to represent elements that are greater than effective median. After processing an incoming element, the number of elements in heaps differ utmost by 1 element. When both heaps contain same number of elements, we pick average of heaps root data as effective median. When the heaps are not balanced, we select effective median from the root of heap containing more elements. Given below is implementation of above method. For algorithm to build these heaps, please read the highlighted code.

 Time Complexity: If we omit the way how stream was read, complexity of median finding is O(N log N), as we need to read the stream, and due to heap insertions/deletions. At first glance the above code may look complex. If you read the code carefully, it is simple algorithm. — Venki.

Muthukumar Suresh hey correct me if I am wrong . in method 3, when you are inserting the method seems fine . But in the case of extracting max or min , the last element is placed in A[0] . the problem with this algo is that this element in A[0] needs to be sifted down to its proper position . Since this algo of heapify propagates upward . that cant be done . We need to sift down like in a normal heapify procedure Rahul Singh Yeah you are right. The heapify for deleteTop needs to sift down the new root.

 Paparao Veeragandham Method2 && Method3 does not work : Example: Max Heap has = 94,90 Min Heap has = 100 Median = 97 If incoming Element is 96 case 1: if ( 96 < 97 ) //remove top element from Max Heap & insert into MinHeap Results : Max Heap has : 90 Min Heap has : 94,100 // Insert 96 into Max heap Results : Max Heap has : 96,90 Min Heap has : 94,100 It is wrong According to Solution description. Because all elements of MaxHeap are lesser-than MinHeap Same Problem present for Method2 also. Correct me if i was wrong………….. /* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */ Abhishek Look carefully Initially when only 3 elements have been added to the heaps, the median is not 97 as u mentioned. It is 94. So when 96 comes it needs to be added to the min heap. After this operation the median will become 95. abhishek08aug Intelligent

 sachin Venki, How can it be done using Balanced BST?I dont think the root will always hold the median.However,the balance factor can be the size of the subtree if the root will hold the median.  
/* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
 Rahul Singh The deleteTop() function in Method 3 is wrong. I case of deletion we need to sift down from the root after exchanging the root with the last element and decrementing the heapSize by 1. To prove my point consider the test case where the heap is {70, 60, 42, 50, 51, 32, 23, 35, 20, 10, 40, 5, 4}. The given deleteTop() method will not run correctly.

 Neha IMO that sol doesn’t handle the constraint that it is a dynamic array, am I missing something? Neha IMO that sol doesn’t handle the constraint that it is a dynamic array, am I missing something? gaurav there is one problem in 3rd solution , in case of delete , argument in heapify function seems wrong , argument while deleting in heap should always be 0 , as we have to place root (which was last number in heap ) at correct position……i am talking about max heap ……sol given here will again put root element at root Paparao Veeragandham

 In Method2 : No need to maintaing the elements. After inserting an element into balanced BST. Find out the left subtree height & Right subtree height Depends on it we can take decision about median elements Sreenivas Doosa @Venki The solution using Heap is really awesome and gr8 explanation. Keep posting duuuude Bhavesh please check for array ={5,15,1,3,2,8,7,9,10,11} ans appears to be wrong when inserting 11 please do reply soon kartik I tried running the code for your input and got the following output 5 10 5 4 3 4 5 6 7 8 The output looks correct. Could you post the complete code that you tried? BlackMath There is some problem in method3.  
/* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
 kartik Please provide more details of your comment. Why do you think that the code will not work? Do you have some sample input for which it didn’t work? par 3rd solution won’t work in case of -ve values, you would need to change the Heapify() to check for +ve and -ve values. Karthick A very clever method using heaps. Nice explanation. But, I felt that it would have been more easily understandable, if the writer of the code had avoided syntaxes that are language specific(eg: using virtual) so that people without the knowledge of the implemented language can understand the code. http://geeksforgeeks.org/?page_id=2 Venki Thanks @Karthick. The idea is to provide simple algorithm in OOP way. Basic C++ skills will be sufficient to follow the code. Akshay Hint: Median Heap ADT http://cracktheinterview.org/ vinay polisetti Can you please gimme the psudocode for method 2. I am fully confused about how it can be implememnted !! http://geeksforgeeks.org/?page_id=2 Venki @Vinay, thanks for pointing this. I guess there seems to be some mistake in method 2. I will update the content. sorry for delay. http://shashank7s.blogspot.com/ WgpShashank @Vinay . We Can Think Like , insert the elements into bst as they arrives & calculate the tree size after processing ith element . now do inorder traversal till x=size/2 , return root as median if x is odd else return left subtree root + root /2 isn’t it ? its just thought , may not work for all cases , but cover basic idea ? kiak what is x here ? The explaination is confusing too. Please explain clearly if you can. http://shashank7s.blogspot.com WgpShashank @Kiak X is just a varible thats holding the value calculated by size/2 . Manohar Singh This can also be done in O(n). Maintain three variables lower,middle and upper. While scanning the inputs keep updating these variables. If n is even median is avg of upper and lower ,otherwise middle is the median. http://geeksforgeeks.org/?page_id=2 Venki @Manohar Singh, The above algorithm is doing same. As per your terminology, lower and upper are maintained in Maxheap and Minheap respectively. Yet the complexity of tracing lower and upper is O(log N) due to heap insertions/deletions. Could you please suggest any other better data structure to organize lower half and upper half? http://shashank7s.blogspot.com WgpShashank @Venki 3rd one , Thats NIce Explanation Keep it UP rakesh mahadasa for method three input [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] output must be 1 – 1 – 2 – 2 – 3 -3 – 5 but the program is giving 1-1-2-2-3-4-5 as output something wrong with the answer
