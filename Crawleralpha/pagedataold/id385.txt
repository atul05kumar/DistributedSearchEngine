According to a report on indianexpress.com, the actor expressed that he faced difficulty in portraying the character of Prem. Salman said, "It’s (‘Prem…’) the most difficult film I am doing in a very, very long time because it’s been 13 years since I have worked with Sooraj. I have changed so much; I’m not that pure person anymore. I have seen a lot more. It is very difficult for me to become that Prem once again. I am having all my films put together and this film separately; just to unlearn everything I have learnt so far. Till that time I don’t get that Prem, I don’t feel it here; it is not going to show on my face. It is actually once again getting me back to what I used to be."  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046760.cms 03 There were a lot of speculations about the actress to be pitted opposite Salman Khan in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. Rumours were doing the rounds that actresses like Deepika Padukone and Sonakshi Sinha had been approached for the film. However it was Sonam Kapoor who bagged the deal. Salman had romanced Sonam in her debut film Saawariya, however it was a brief role. According to a report in The Times of India, Sonam Kapoor said, "It's been seven years since I worked with him. Working with Salman is like the weirdest thing because I have grown up watching Prem (Salman's character) and it's like, 'Oh my god! Prem is romancing me.' I have grown up with his films like Hum Aapke Hain Koun...! and Maine Pyar Kiya, and it's just like an 'Oh my god moment!'. So I had to pinch myself at times." The actress further praised Salman saying, "I have never seen him being nasty to anyone or rude to anybody. He has immense respect for women and he is extremely hardworking. He is always on time, always improvising. He is one of the best actors I have ever worked with. He is always trying to do something different." On the other hand, reports were also rife that Salman Khan was a bit shy about romancing Sonam Kapoor.  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046755.cms 04 After a long time, Salman Khan will be seen playing a double role in a movie. In the past, Salman has portrayed a double role in Judwaa. According to a Mumbai Mirror report, the actor will be seen playing the role of a king who presides over a mythical kingdom and the other one will be that of a common man. An excited Sonam Kapoor had said in an interview with Hindustan Times, "He is hot. It's double 'dhamaal' with Salman since he is in double role. I am super excited to work with him. I am not allowed to talk about it. You will see. He is looking good in the film."  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046754.cms 05 When it is a Barjatya film, there has to be a lot of dance and music. And Prem Ratan Dhan Payo will apparently have nine songs and the music has been composed by Himesh Reshammiya. Speaking to indianexpress.com, Himesh said, "These nine songs will all be different from the other and shall belong to varied genres. Since both Salman and Sooraj ji have a good ear for music, they will be melodious and shall suit Salman Bhai's character in the film perfectly. I have been working on these compositions along with lyricist Irshad Kamil, who has written some really beautiful lyrics with meaningful words that not only suit the situation, but also command a lot of audio value and personal identification for the listener.”  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046753.cms 06 Sooraj Barjatya is known to shoot elaborate sequences. One can recall the entertaining cricket sequence from Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! and something similar is to be expected in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the film will have a song-and-dance sequence. The report quoted a source saying, "The earlier film had the entire family, including the dog Tuffy, come together for a game of cricket in the 'Dhik Tana' song. This time they will be playing football, the game of the season. It's a big song and will be extravagantly mounted. But don't expect the actors to wear any football jerseys. In true Barjatya-style, the whole family will be seen playing footie in 'sherwanis' and 'saris'!" The report said that Himesh Reshammiya has composed the song while it has been choreographed by Ahmed Khan and shot in Karjat.  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046752.cms 07 One of Salman's characters in the film is that of a king. From the initial look of it, the actor looks stunning in the royal attires. Salman Khan has been spotted wearing a turban with designer kurtas. A Mumbai Mirror report stated that Salman Khan's look is being designed by Jodhpur-based designer Raghavendra Rathore, Ashley Rebello and Alvira Khan. The report further quoted a source saying, "Salman's character, who is a contemporary royal, will be seen donning over 15 outfits in the course of the film."  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046748.cms 08 Prem Ratan Dhan Payo also stars Neil Nitin Mukesh. According to a Mumbai Mirror report, Neil has been signed up to play the character of Salman Khan's step brother who is younger to him. "The makers have had lengthy discussions with Neil, who has consented to Sooraj in principle. But, he is yet to sign on the dotted line. Neil is really kicked about the film. Bagging a Sooraj Barjatya film could revive his career which hasn't been in great shape lately following a series of duds. Neil is not the archetypal younger brother. His character is not negative but has shades of grey," the article quoted a source.  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046746.cms 09 Prem Ratan Dhan Payo will be an out-and-out Sooraj Barjatya film. Apparently its title also has a story to it. Previously it was rumoured to be titled as Bade Bhaiyya. According to a report on hindustantimes.com, the film derived its title from a popular bhajan. Staying true to the Barjatya style, Salman Khan's character will be called Prem in the film. In the past, almost all films of Salman Khan under the Barjatya banner have had his name as Prem.  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film /prem-ratan-dhan-payo-lesser-known-facts-about-the-salman-khan-film/eventshow/45046744.cms 10 Prem Ratan Dhan Payo has an ensemble cast and interestingly it was reported that Armaan Kohli will also be a part of the movie.

According to a Mumbai Mirror report, Armaan will be playing Salman Khan's younger brother in the film. If things work out, then this film will mark Armaan's comeback in the industry after almost a decade. The report also stated that Salman, Neil and Armaan will be brothers in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo.  Prem Ratan Dhan Payo: Lesser known facts about the Salman Khan film 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 pagination.cms?msid=45046741&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
