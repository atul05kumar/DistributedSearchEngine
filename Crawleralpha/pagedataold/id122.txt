Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc. And some sorting algorithms are not, like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc. However, any given sorting algo which is not stable can be modified to be stable. There can be sorting algo specific ways to make it stable, but in general, any comparison based sorting algorithm which is not stable by nature can be modified to be stable by changing the key comparison operation so that the comparison of two keys considers position as a factor for objects with equal keys.

Shruthi.B.S Say you have a list with each item having information about destination of the flight and departure time. You first sort the list based on time. We then sort it based on destination. If the second sort is stable we now have all flights bound to same destination together and in increasing order of departure time. If it wasn’t stable, they wouldn’t be in increasing order of time. gvk The requested URL /www.math.uic.edu/~leon/cs-mcs401-s08/handouts/stability.pdf was not found on this server.
