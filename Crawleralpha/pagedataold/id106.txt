Space Complexity: The term Space Complexity is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity. Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criteria than Space Complexity. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. Space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though.

Please use ideone.com and share the link here. thyagu can you cheat worst case running time of an algorithm sawan can we directly exit from recursion and return to the calling fn. like in case of recursive version of linear search. #include int i; int linear_search(int arr[], int x, int n) { if(arr[i]==x) return i; if(i>=n) return -1; i++ ; return linear_search(arr,x,n); } int main() { int arr[]={2,12,43,12,3,23,14,23,43,56,68,4,13}; int size=sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int); int x=52; printf(“%d is presnt in array at index %d”,x,linear_search(arr,x,size)); return 0; } here in function linear_search….after getting the index, is there any way to directly go to main. Sen Could you please have one tutorial on the 3 notations used for complexity analysis i.e. (Theta,Ohm and Big-O) ? Whats exact difference between these and which to use when ?

 kartikaditya In recursive algo’s like merge sort, the compiler may end up eating space for stack frames, which is important from a programming point of view. How do I classify such external space? lp Is there any sorting algorithm whose Space Complexity is not O(n)? kartik Space complexity of almost all standard sorting algorithms is at least O(n). There are few exceptions like External Sorting. Jagat I wouldn’t worry about the “in-memory” space used by the external sorting algorithm which is usually considered to be the whole RAM size per basic chunk, for optimal I/O. Having said that, external merge process would still require O(n) auxiliary space on the disk since in-place merge is only of theoretical interest and anything more than O(n) is not necessary. lp How much auxiliary space is needed for Quick Sort? kartik Quick Sort needs O(n) extra space in worst case and O(Logn) in average case. Worst case happens when all elements are sorted. ibn Not sure I see it clear. If Quick sort take O(n) aux space, what would merge sort takes? n aux space + 2n recursive call (assume complete binary tree) = 3n aux space. Am I right? Jagat Quick sort requires no “explicit” auxiliary space since all the sorting happens in place. However, because of the recursive calls, which can go upto a depth of O(n) in the worst case and O(log n) in the average case, the auxiliary space required by the system stack can be considered to be O(n).
