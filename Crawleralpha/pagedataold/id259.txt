The tablets had gone up for pre-orders in the country on e-commerce websites earlier this week. The biggest company in the world, Apple had unveiled the two globally at an event in late October. Below are the prices of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 in India: iPad Air 2 iPad mini 3 16GB Wi-Fi Rs 35,900 Rs 28,900 16GB Wi-Fi + 3G Rs 45,900 Rs 38,900 64GB Wi-Fi Rs 42,900 Rs 35,900 64GB Wi-Fi + 3G Rs 52,900 Rs 35,900 128GB Wi-Fi Rs 49,900 Rs 42,900 128GB Wi-Fi + 3G Rs 59,900 Rs 52,900 iPad Air 2 is 18% thinner than its predecessor and measures just 6.1mm. The screen size remains constant at 9.7-inch, but now boasts of anti-reflective laminated coating that reduces glare by over half. Weighing less than half a kilogram, iPad Air 2 features an improved Retina display for enhanced contrast. iPad Air 2 also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor button and gold colour option, which were introduced in iPhone 5S last year. READ ALSO: Don't buy iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2 is just as good The world's thinnest tablet, iPad Air 2 is powered by a specially-designed A8X chip with second-generation 64-bit architecture and 40% faster CPU. It is an improved variation of the A8 chip used in iPhone 6 and 6 Plus by Apple. iPad Air 2 also has an M8 motion co-processor, just like the iPhone 6. The camera too has got an upgrade. The new iPad Air 2 sports an 8MP iSight camera (instead of 5MP in earlier version) with f/2.4 aperture and an improved front-facing 1.2MP Facetime HD camera. The rear camera can shoot 1080p and slow motion video. The new iSight camera's image signal processor has been designed by Apple itself. Despite the upgraded microprocessor, faster Wi-Fi (with 802.11ac Wi-Fi with Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MIMO) technology) and broader LTE wireless support, iPad Air 2 will have a 10-hour battery life, same as in the earlier iPad Air. While iPad Air 2 comes with such improvements over its predecessor, the new iPad mini 3 has not seen many upgrades. In fact, it is essentially the same as iPad mini 2 barring the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and gold colour option.

Amazon.in : Buy now Apple iPad Air 2: Six new features of 7 Apple has finally taken the covers off its latest razor-sharp tablet, iPad Air 2. The new model boasts of several changes, including thinner body, new gold colour option, fingerprint scanner, faster processor and better camera. Let's take a look at the six new features of Apple iPad Air 2 over its predecessor... Apple has shaved a few milimetres off the original iPad Air's thickness and achieved an 18% thinner body for iPad Air 2. The model is just 6.1mm thick and weighs 437grams, making it the sleekest tablet in the market right now. Though its screen size and resolution remain the same as that of its predecessor, iPad Air 2 one major upgrade is in the display department. The screen is thinner this time around as Apple has fused three layers (touch sensor, LCD panel and cover glass) into one fully-laminated layer, which results in vibrant colours and greater contrast. Apple has also added an anti-glare coating on the screen of iPad Air 2 and claims that it reduces glare by 56%, thus making it the least reflective tablet in the world. Apple says that iPad Air 2's A8X processor, which is based on 64-bit chipset architecture, delivers better performance than its predecessor without sacrificing the battery life. The chip processes applications 40% faster and renders graphics 2.5 times faster, but still ensures average battery life of 10 hours. Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which was restricted to iPhones so far, finally makes its way to Apple's tablet lineup with iPad Air 2. It can be used to not only unlock the tablet, but also to authorize passwords within apps and purchase/download content via iTunes, iBooks and App Store. As it works with the new Apple Pay technology, it can be used to make online payments via a swipe of the finger. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=iPad Mini 3,iPad Air 2,iPad,Apple,Apple Tablets Stay updated on the go with The Times of India’s mobile apps.
