A 24 B 25 C 26 D 27 Discuss it Question 53 The employee information in a company is stored in the relation 
Employee (name, sex, salary, deptName) Consider the following SQL query 
select deptName
       from Employee
       where sex = 'M'
       group by deptName
       having avg (salary) > (select avg (salary) from Employee)
 It returns the names of the department in which A the average salary is more than the average salary in the company B the average salary of male employees is more than the average salary of all male employees in the company C the average salary of male employees is more than the average salary of employees in the same department D the average salary of male employees is more than the average salary in the company Discuss it Question 54 A and B are the only two stations on an Ethernet. Each has a steady queue of frames to send. Both A and B attempt to transmit a frame, collide, and A wins the first backoff race. At the end of this successful transmission by A, both A and B attempt to transmit and collide. The probability that A wins the second backoff race is: A 0.5 B 0.625 C 0.75 D 1.0 Discuss it Question 55 The routing table of a router is shown below: 
 Destination     Sub net mask 	     Interface
 128.75.43.0 	 255.255.255.0 	        Eth0
 128.75.43.0 	 255.255.255.128 	Eth1
 192.12.17.5 	 255.255.255.255 	Eth3
 default 	  	                Eth2 On which interfaces will the router forward packets addressed to destinations 128.75.43.16 and 192.12.17.10 respectively? A Eth1 and Eth2 B Eth0 and Eth2 C Eth0 and Eth3 D Eth1 and Eth3 Discuss it Question 55 Explanation:  To find the interface, we need to do AND of incoming IP address and Subnet mask. Compare the result of AND with the destination. Note that if there is a match between multiple Destinations, then we need to select the destination with longest length subnet mask. 128.75.43.16, matches with 128.75.43.0 and 128.75.43.0, the packet is forwarded to Eth1 as length of subnet mask in Eth11 is more. If a result is not matching with any of the given destinations then the packet is forwarded to the default interface (here Eth2). Therefore the packet's addressed to 192.12.17.10 will be forwarded to Eth2. Question 56 Consider three IP networks A, B and C. Host HA in network A sends messages each containing 180 bytes of application data to a host HC in network C. The TCP layer prefixes a 20 byte header to the message. This passes through an intermediate net­work B. The maximum packet size, including 20 byte IP header, in each network is A : 1000 bytes B : 100 bytes C : 1000 bytes The network A and B are connected through a 1 Mbps link, while B and C are connected by a 512 Kbps link (bps = bits per second). Assuming that the packets are correctly delivered, how many bytes, including headers, are delivered to the IP layer at the destination for one application message, in the best case ? Consider only data packets. A 200 B 220 C 240 D 260 Discuss it Question 56 Explanation:  Network B receives 220 bytes of data (180 bytes of application layer data + 20 bytes of TCP header + 20 bytes of IP header) from network A. As maximum packet size of network B is 100 bytes (data of 80 bytes + 20 bytes IP header), for network B, out of 220 Bytes, 200 bytes would be of data or payload (180 bytes of application layer data + 20 bytes of TCP header) and 20 bytes of IP header. Network B now removes the 20 bytes header. Out of 200 bytes of data, it uses 80 bytes of data. Thus 1st packet leaving B would be of 100 bytes (Data: 80 bytes, IP header: 20 bytes). Now we have 120 bytes of data remaining. Thus the 2nd packet leaving B would be of 100 bytes (Data: 80 bytes, IP header: 20 bytes). Now we have 40 bytes of data remaining. Thus the 3rd packet leaving B would be of 60 bytes (Data: 40 bytes, IP header: 20 bytes). Hence, total of 100 + 100 + 60 bytes = 260 bytes would be received by the destination. Thanks to Sohil Ladhani for providing this explanation. Question 57 Consider three IP networks A, B and C. Host HA in network A sends messages each containing 180 bytes of application data to a host HC in network C. The TCP layer prefixes a 20 byte header to the message. This passes through an intermediate net­work B. The maximum packet size, including 20 byte IP header, in each network is A : 1000 bytes B : 100 bytes C : 1000 bytes The network A and B are connected through a 1 Mbps link, while B and C are connected by a 512 Kbps link (bps = bits per second). What is the rate at which application data is transferred to host HC? Ignore errors, acknowledgements, and other overheads.

Each microinstruction is divided into three fields: a micro-operation field of 13 bits, a next address field (X), and a MUX select field (Y). There are 8 status bits in the inputs of the MUX. How many bits are there in the X and Y fields, and what is the size of the control memory in number of words? A 10, 3, 1024 B 8, 5, 256 C 5, 8, 2048 D 10, 3, 512 Discuss it Question 67 A hard disk with a transfer rate of 10 Mbytes/ second is constantly transferring data to memory using DMA.

Their product in 2's complement is A 1100 0100 B 1001 1100 C 1010 0101 D 1101 0101 Discuss it Question 69 A 4-stage pipeline has the stage delays as 150, 120, 160 and 140 nanoseconds respectively. Registers that are used between the stages have a delay of 5 nanoseconds each. Assuming constant clocking rate, the total time taken to process 1000 data items on this pipeline will be A 120.4 microseconds B 160.5 microseconds C 165.5 microseconds D 590.0 microseconds Discuss it Question 69 Explanation:  
Delay between each stage is 5 ns.
Total delay in pipline = 150 + 120 + 160 + 140 = 570
Total delay for one data item = 570 + 5*3 (Note that there are 3 intermediate registers)
                              = 585 
For 1000 data items, first data will take 585 ns to complete and rest 
999 data will take max of all the stages that is 160 ns + 5 ns register delay

Total Delay = 585 + 999*165 ns which is approximately 165.5 microsecond.

y  = 1/4
x  = 9/4 Question 72 The following is the incomplete operation table a 4-element group.

 The last row of the table is A c a e b B c b a e C c b e a D c e a b Discuss it Question 72 Explanation:  It is given that the given set of 4 elements is group. The element 'e' is clearly identity as the row corresponding to it has all values same as the other operand. Also, since a*c is e, c*a should also be e which is only the case in option D Question 73 The inclusion of which of the following sets into 
S = {{1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 5}, (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5}} is necessary and sufficient to make S a complete lattice under the partial order defined by set containment ? A {1} B {1}, {2, 3} C {1}, {1, 3} D {1}, {1, 3}, (1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 5) Discuss it Question 74 An examination paper has 150 multiple-choice questions of one mark each, with each question having four choices. Each incorrect answer fetches -0.25 mark. Suppose 1000 students choose all their answers randomly with uniform probablity. The sum total of the expected marks obtained by all these students is: A 0 B 2550 C 7525 D 9375 Discuss it Question 74 Explanation:  
Expected marks per question is = -0.25 * 3/4 + 1 * 1/4 = 1/16
Since choice is uniformly distributed, expected marks = 150*1000/16 = 9375 Question 75 Mala has a colouring book in which each English letter is drawn two times. She wants to paint each of these 52 prints with one of k colours, such that the colour-pairs used to colour any two letters are different. Both prints of a letter can also be coloured with the same colour. What is the minimum value of k that satisfies this requirement ? A 9 B 8 C 7 D 6 Discuss it Question 75 Explanation:  This question is slightly ambiguous. So first let us understand what question is asking. So in a book, we have letters A-Z and each letter is printed twice, so there are 52 letters. Now we have to color each letter, so we need a pair of colors for that, because each letter is printed twice. Also in a pair, both colors can be some. Now condition is that a pair of colors can't be used more than once. So suppose Mala has 3 colors : Red, Blue, Green. She can color as follows : (A,A) : (Red,Red), (B,B) : (Blue,Blue), (C,C) : (Green,Green), (D,D) : (Red,Blue), (E,E) : (Red,Green), (F,F) : (Blue,Green). Now we don't have more pairs of colors left, we have used all pairs, but could color only 6 letters out of 26. So question is to find minimum no. of colors, so that we could color all 26 letters. So if Mala has k colors, she can have k pairs of same colors, thus coloring k letters, then kC2 other pairs of colors, thus coloring kC2 more letters. So total no. of letters colored = k+kC2=k+k(k−1)2=k(k+1)2. So we want k(k+1)2≥26 i.e. k(k+1)≥52, so k≥7, so option (C) is correct.

Then the maximum number of non-zero entries, such that no two are on the same row or column, is A ≤ a + b B ≤ max {a, b} C ≤ min {M-a, N-b} D ≤ min {a, b} Discuss it Question 76 Explanation:  Suppose a < b, for example let a = 3, b= 5, then we can put non-zero entries only in 3 rows and 5 columns. So suppose we put non-zero entries in any 3 rows in 3 different columns. Now we can't put any other non-zero entry anywhere in matrix, because if we put it in some other row, then we will have 4 rows containing non-zeros, if we put it in one of those 3 rows, then we will have more than one non-zero entry in one row, which is not allowed. So we can fill only "a" non-zero entries if a < b, similarly if b < a, we can put only "b" non-zero entries. So answer is ≤min(a,b), because whatever is less between a and b, we can put atmost that many non-zero entries. So option (D) is correct.

The probability that the Hamming distance between these strings (the number of bit positions where the two strings differ) is equal to d is A nCd /2n B nCd / d C d/2n D 1/2d Discuss it Question 78 Explanation:  There are two string s1 and s2, so probability of selection of any one is 1/2. Length of string is n bit and hamming distance is d bit so applying binomial distribution- nCd(1/2)^d(1/2)^n - d = nCd(1/2)^d+n-d = nCd /2n Question 79 How many graphs on n labeled vertices exist which have at least (n2 - 3n)/2 edges ? A A B B C C D D Discuss it Question 80 A point is randomly selected with uniform probability in the X-Y plane within the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,2) and (0,2). If p is the length of the position vector of the point, the expected value of p2 is A 2/3 B 1 C 4/3 D 5/3 Discuss it Question 80 Explanation:  Here minimum value of p can be 0 (if point chosen is (0,0), then length of position vector will be 0), and maximum value can be 5√ when point chosen is (1,2), because that is the farthest point from origin. So p can vary from 0 to 5√. Now we know that [Tex]E(p^2) = \int^\sqrt{5}_0 p^2*P(p)\,dp[/Tex] Since p is a uniform random variable, [Tex]P(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}-0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}[/Tex] So [Tex]E(p^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\frac{p^3}{3}\right]^{\sqrt{5}}_0 = \frac{5}{3}[/Tex] So option (D) is correct.

If G1 ∩ G2 = (V, E1 ∩ E2) is not a connected graph, then the graph G1 U G2 = (V, E1 U E2) A cannot have a cut vertex B must have a cycle C must have a cut-edge (bridge) D has chromatic number strictly greater than those of G1 and G2 Discuss it Question 81 Explanation:  Note that G1 and G2 are connected graphs on same vertex set. Question 82 Let A[1, ..., n] be an array storing a bit (1 or 0) at each location, and f(m) is a unction whose time complexity is θ(m). Consider the following program fragment written in a C like language: 
counter = 0;
for (i = 1; i < = n; i++)
{ 
      if (A[i] == 1) 
         counter++;
      else {

         counter = 0;
      }
} The complexity of this program fragment is A Ω(n2) B Ω(nlog n) and O(n2) C θ(n) D O(n) Discuss it Question 82 Explanation:  Please note that inside the else condition, f() is called first, then counter is set to 0. Consider the following cases: 
a) All 1s in A[]: Time taken is Θ(n) as
                  only counter++ is executed n times.

b) All 0s in A[]: Time taken is Θ(n) as
                  only f(0) is called n times

c) Half 1s, then half 0s: Time taken is  Θ(n) as

The recurrence relation for the recursive function is
T(N) = 2 * T(N/2) + n/2
Where N is the total no. of nodes in the tree.
T(N) = 2 * (2*T(N/2) + n/2) + n/2
     = 4 * T(N/2) + 3(n/2)
Solve this till T(1) i.e. till we reach the root.
T(N) = c * T(N / 2^i) + (2*i - 1) * (n/2)
Where i = lg(N)
