Get Access Abstract Computing shortest paths in a directed graph has received considerable attention in the sequential RAM model of computation. However, developing a polylog-time parallel algorithm that is close to the sequential optimal in terms of the total work done remains an elusive goal. We present a first step in this direction by giving efficient parallel algorithms for shortest paths in planar layered digraphs. We show that these graphs admit special kinds of separators calledone- way separators which allow the paths in the graph to cross it only once. We use these separators to give divide- and -conquer solutions to the problem of finding the shortest paths between any two vertices. We first give a simple algorithm that works in the CREW model and computes the shortest path between any two vertices in ann-node planar layered digraph in timeO(log2 n) usingn/logn processors. We then use results of Aggarwal and Park [1] and Atallah [4] to improve the time bound toO(log2 n) in the CREW model andO(logn log logn) in the CREW model. The processor bounds still remain asn/logn for the CREW model andn/log logn for the CRCW model.
