Get Access Abstract For an integers letl s (n), thes-iterated logarithm function, be defined inductively:l 0 (n)=n,l s+1 (n)=log2 (l 2 (n)) fors≧0. We show that for every fixeds and alln large enough, there is ann-vertex 3-pushdown graph whose smallest separator contains at leastΩ(n/l s (n)) vertices.
