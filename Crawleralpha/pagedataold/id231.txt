While in one of the episodes, the duo was seen cosying up under the blanket, in another one, Gautam and Diandra locked themselves up in the bathroom. After a long passionate exchange between the two, Diandra expressed the wish to gift Gautam on his birthday. A startled Gautam then asked a rather spirited Diandra as to what she meant by a gift. Hinting at the many cameras, he also questioned Diandra of the possibility of a 'gift.' But the feisty Diandra was undeterred as she dragged a confused and blushing Gautam to the washroom before locking themselves up in one of the stalls.
