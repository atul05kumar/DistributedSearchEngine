Both are considered as industry superpowers who have all the resources to set the cash registers ringing. Their mere presence in a movie is a sure shot way to make it a blockbuster. Hence, they are always in demand for films, endorsements, award functions, TV soaps or social events. They have a huge star presence and hence are also the biggest rivals of B-Town. Though there have been incidents when these two former friends have had their differences, both Salman and Shah Rukh have also come together for many causes.  Things that brought Salman-Shah Rukh Khan together /things-that-brought-salman-shah-rukh-khan-together/Arpita-Khan-wedding-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-fight-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-hug-Salman-SRK-rivalry-Salman-Khan-Shah-Rukh-Khan/eventshow/45188963.cms 03 Arpita's wedding: Salman Khan’s younger sister Arpita Khan’s wedding is in news for the most obvious of reasons. She achieved the impossible by bringing together the two reported rivals of B-Town. Speculations were rife that Salman might invite SRK for his little sister’s wedding and SRK might oblige him by attending it. However, doubts were put to rest when Salman graciously sent an invite to Shah Rukh and SRK said that he does not even need an invite for Arpita's wedding. He had gone on record to say that he had known Arpita since she was a little baby and hence he will definitely go for her wedding. In fact, SRK was seen enjoying every moment of the mehendi ceremony by being warm and getting clicked with Salman and talking with Salman’s father, Salim Khan. In fact, a report in Bollywoodlife.com says that SRK gifted Arpita a huge hamper of designer bags. Since Arpita loves designer bags, SRK got her the latest and best hand bags of the biggest international brands in the market.  Things that brought Salman-Shah Rukh Khan together /things-that-brought-salman-shah-rukh-khan-together/eventshow/45199679.cms 04 Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan's reunion at the latter's sister Arpita Khan's sangeet ceremony brought smiles on the faces of their fans. Their picture clicked while sharing a warm moment with Arpita had gone viral. However, everyone who got the glimpse of that moment missed the third Khan, Aamir in the frame. When questioned about the patch-up between SRK-Salman, Aamir said, "Yes, I got to know about the patch-up. In fact, they didn't let me sleep the entire night. Around 1:30 am, they first called me and informed about it. Then around 2:30 am, we did a face-time call. So this went on till early morning and they kept me awake." Aamir gave this statement while interacting with the media at the Mumbai airport, before leaving for the wedding, with wife Kiran Rao and son Azad. We look at incidents that brought the 'rivals' together…  Things that brought Salman-Shah Rukh Khan together /things-that-brought-salman-shah-rukh-khan-together/Arpita-Khan-wedding-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-fight-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-hug-Salman-SRK-rivalry-Salman-Khan-Shah-Rukh-Khan/eventshow/45188996.cms 05 Award ceremonies: After their much publicised hug at an iftaar party in 2013, the warring Khans also hugged during the Star Guild Awards held in January, 2014. While Salman Khan was enthralling the audience as the host, he was gracious enough to hug his reported rival Shah Rukh Khan on the stage. When Shah Rukh went on stage to receive his award for the Entertainer of the Year, Salman stepped forward and hugged SRK, much to the delight of the audience. It was said that Salman even congratulated SRK for the success of his film Chennai Express at the ceremony.  Things that brought Salman-Shah Rukh Khan together /things-that-brought-salman-shah-rukh-khan-together/Arpita-Khan-wedding-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-fight-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-hug-Salman-SRK-rivalry-Salman-Khan-Shah-Rukh-Khan/eventshow/45189084.cms 06 Iftaar parties: It was expected to be a face-off when Salman and Shah Rukh Khan came face to face at an iftaar party thrown by MLA and former minister Baba Siddiqui last year. However, the two warring Khans kept their differences aside and gave each other a warm embrace, much to the shock of the onlookers. It is said while SRK was eating, Salman came and tapped SRK on his shoulder. SRK turned towards him and Salman embraced him. The hug became the most talked-about topic of discussion and got a lot of media coverage. It was considered as a new phase in their relationship. The two Khans continued the tradition and hugged each other again at another iftaar party this year.  Things that brought Salman-Shah Rukh Khan together /things-that-brought-salman-shah-rukh-khan-together/Arpita-Khan-wedding-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-fight-Salman-Shah-Rukh-Khan-hug-Salman-SRK-rivalry-Salman-Khan-Shah-Rukh-Khan/eventshow/45189113.cms 07 Movies: Salman and Shah Rukh Khan have done several movies in the past. Be it Rakesh Roshan’s Karan Arjun where Salman and SRK played brothers or Karan Johar’s Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Salman and SRK have done several movies together. In fact, it is indeed a privilege for any filmmaker to bring these two megastars together for a movie. We so wish to see them together again on screen.

The game show was then hosted by King Khan and Salman was accompanied by his former girlfriend Katrina Kaif in the show. The episode was historic as it had both the warring Khans sitting in front of each other. Salman and Katrina had come as celebrity guests to win the prize money for a charity.  Things that brought Salman-Shah Rukh Khan together 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 pagination.cms?msid=45188949&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
