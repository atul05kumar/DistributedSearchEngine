Splay Tree | Set 1 (Search) As discussed in the previous post, Splay tree is a self-balancing data structure where the last accessed key is always at root. The insert operation is similar to Binary Search Tree insert with additional steps to make sure that the newly inserted key becomes the new root. Following are different cases to insert a key k in splay tree. 1) Root is NULL: We simply allocate a new node and return it as root. 2) Splay the given key k. If k is already present, then it becomes the new root. If not present, then last accessed leaf node becomes the new root. 3) If new root’s key is same as k, don’t do anything as k is already present. 4) Else allocate memory for new node and compare root’s key with k. …….4.a) If k is smaller than root’s key, make root as right child of new node, copy left child of root as left child of new node and make left child of root as NULL. …….4.b) If k is greater than root’s key, make root as left child of new node, copy right child of root as right child of new node and make right child of root as NULL. 5) Return new node as new root of tree.

This code is really easy to understand. btw: Can you explain how to remove a key? h how is the tree you have shown in figure height balanced? I dont think it is height balanced, please correct if i am wrong. Kartik Please note that the splay trees give average performance as Logn, they may become unbalanced after certain operations.
