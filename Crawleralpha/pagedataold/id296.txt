First left shift the number by 3 bits (you will get 8n) then subtract the original numberfrom the shifted number and return the difference (8n – n). Program: 
# include<stdio.h>

int multiplyBySeven(unsigned int n)
{  
    /* Note the inner bracket here. This is needed 
       because precedence of '-' operator is higher 
       than '<<' */
    return ((n<<3) - n);
}

/* Driver program to test above function */
int main()
{
    unsigned int n = 4;
    printf("%u", multiplyBySeven(n));

    getchar();
    return 0;
}
 Time Complexity: O(1) Space Complexity: O(1) Note: Works only for positive integers. Same concept can be used for fast multiplication by 9 or other numbers.           Related Topics: Check if binary representation of a number is palindrome Swap two nibbles in a byte How to turn off a particular bit in a number?

Please use ideone.com and share the link here. Nimish why not n+(n<<1)+(n<<2) ? as bit shifts are still three only, though not don at once, but instead of one "-" we use "+" two times. using "+" can be more efficient than using "-" i guess. vindhya someone plz explain this..how does it give O(1) complexity??sorry i m weak at it..plz..thanks

 frankc Is it possible to use divide and conquer and the “clever” multiplication algorithm to obtain an efficient way to multiply by 7 or 15?

 bala Sometimes ,we do have to take care of overflow even if multiplication by 7 or 15 is going to be within MAX_INT nitesh.gami008 @bala….Please give some example…. adsf Consider this binary number 0100 0000 how will you shift 3 times without handling overflow Correct me if i am wrong Interview Experiences Advanced Data Structures Dynamic Programming Greedy Algorithms Backtracking Pattern Searching Divide & Conquer Mathematical Algorithms Recursion Geometric Algorithms Popular Posts All permutations of a given string Memory Layout of C Programs Understanding “extern” keyword in C Median of two sorted arrays Tree traversal without recursion and without stack!
