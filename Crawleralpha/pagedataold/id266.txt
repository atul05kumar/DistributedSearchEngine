RELATED NEW DELHI: After a lull following Bureau of India Standards (BIS) compliance requirements, it appears that the Indian tablet market is finally witnessing signs of revival. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the India tablet market reported the strongest year to date growth in Q3 2014, fuelled by festive buying and strengthening commercial demand. Tablet market shipments in India witnessed a strong quarter-on-quarter growth of 10% making it a 0.94 million units market. The country is still an Android-dominated market with Samsung taking the lead at a 22.2% market share, followed by Micromax at 10.9% and iBall at 10.6%. Apple's iOS-powered iPad has a market share of 6.7% while other players have a combined market share of 41.4%. IDC informs that Samsung continues to lead the market by a wide gap to its next competitor and the brand fared well on the higher screen sized tablets. Micromax retained its second spot but saw a decline of 15% in Q3 against Q2 2014. Windows based tablets priced under $200 are expected to accelerate the adoption rate, albeit from a low base, as per the research firm. It also observed that phablets are eating up the market share of small screen tablets. "Due to continuous onslaught from the "Phablets" (which IDC defines as 5.5 inches -6.99 inches screen size smartphones), small screen tablets are taking a hit and there is more uptake on tablets which are screen sized between 8-9 inches. This has however led to an overall improvement of the average selling price for the category," says Kiran Kumar, research manager, client devices, IDC India. IDC forecasts that for 2015, commercial segment is likely to grow in comparison to a stable consumer market and government projects and government aided education projects should remain key to the growth in the commercial tablets. "We are likely to see increased activity by PC OEMs in the tablets space with a focus on the 7 inch and 8 inch form factor," adds Tanvi Mann, Market Analyst, IDC India Amazon.in : Buy now http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Samsung Tablets,Samsung,Micromax Stay updated on the go with The Times of India’s mobile apps.
