By Vivek Kumar Posted on Mar 26, 2014 at 04:57 pm http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117934 Afterlife ‹ › Do you believe in afterlife? We will specifically talk about whether Islam believes in afterlife or not. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117936 The Islamic belief ‹ › The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the Qur'an is descriptive. The Islamic word for Paradise is Jannah and Hell is Jahannam. Their level of comfort while in the grave depends wholly on their level of Iman or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being God or Allah. In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy Iman one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of Iman chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice Islam long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire Tasbih and recite the names of Allah in such manner as "SubahannAllah" or Glory be to Allah over and over again to acquire good deeds. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117938 Islamic teachings ‹ › Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship the Creator of the Heavens and Earth—Allah alone that includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode be it punishment or Jannat in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117940 The modern world ‹ › In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117942 Jannah and Jahannam ‹ › Jannah and Jahannam both have different levels. Jannah has seven gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. Jahannam possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during Judgment Day, which commences after the Angel Israfil blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117944 Day of Judgement ‹ › Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell. Resurrection and the Day of Judgment A central doctrine of the Qur'an is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117946 The last day ‹ › The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour. Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117948 Bound for hell ‹ › Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time. The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them"?). http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117950 On the last day ‹ › On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117952 What Sufism thinks of it? ‹ › The Sufi scholar Ibn 'Arabi defined Barzakh as the intermediate realm or "isthmus". It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, “is anything that separates two things”. It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death. http://m.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/mysticism/does-islam-believe-in-afterlife/117954 What you think about it? ‹ › So, what do you think about this concept? Would be interesting to know what you have say about this topic. Comments (2) Raaghav Srivastav 2 mins ago couple of questions before i respond to the questions posed 1) after death of humans where are they waiting/posted for the judgement day. 2) you have quoted "Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell". why only humans what about those who have passed away, do you still call them humans, if so why, if not then do they not go thru judegement day. my intention is to get answers and be logical, plz take it in a positive sense so that you can provide me with answers which i have been seeking and would help me understand islam better... Pkumar 1 hr ago If Islam believe this Allah is coming and recreating their body, and sending them to either Hell or Heaven.. then my suggestion to them, why you not change your religion and come to Hinduism, where your dead body will be burn so that you will get freedom from all these hell and heaven?? You will get freedom because you overcome from this body. Not all people have a beautiful body, many are hate their body, why then they want the same body again after death!! This is complete false, that Allah coming to earth only for judgement day. There is no evidence so don't believe this.
