But there are ways which can help you kick the butt. However, if you are confused how to start or are getting stuck quite often or simply too lazy to quit, we list down few pointers which will help you to quit the smoking habit or at least will help you get started. 1. Have the 'reward' system: Quitting isn't easy, let's face it. Plan things out and start with small rewards. For instance, reward yourself you have reduced the number of cigarettes, you can also give yourself another small reward, when you skip smoking for an entire week and so on and so forth. Write down your plan of action on a piece of paper and stick it on your cubical wall, and on your fridge where you can easily see it, so that the next time you have that urge of puffing out, you know what is your next reward and can hence prevent it. 2. Include your dear ones in the plan: There are certain plans which require your loved ones support, care, love and affection more than anything else. While you have already decided to quit smoking, now its time to let the big guns out and declare this news to your family, friends and loved ones and ask them to always support you and taunt you if and when you have the urge to smoke. Usually tough love is what we need to quit our smoking addiction. 3. Set a date: Yes, you read that right! Setting a date is important as you have enough time to inform your family and friends about your decision and at the same time plan things which will help you to sail through the tough times. Also keep your folks informed about the date. 4. Sugarless candy: Chew on some sugarless gum or hard candy, or even you can munch on on raw carrots, celery, nuts or fresh fruits that will be crunchy, healthy and satisfying 5. Join a group or forum: With technology seeping into our world so swiftly, join an online group or a forum which will help you to quit smoking. These groups will not only help you to quit smoking, but as you will be a in group you will be driven by several factors which will make things easier. Also as the group members understand the urge and nicotine craving they will be able to help you and vice-a-verse to quit. 6. Start exercising: A healthy body is a temple where a healthy mind and soul resides. Enroll in gym or yoga and start working out regularly. Smoking decreases your stamina while regular exercises ups your stamina. Not only will exercises help you to achieve a healthy body but will also help you to quit smoking.
