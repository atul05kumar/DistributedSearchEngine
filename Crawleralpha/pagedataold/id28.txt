Naive [O(N*M2)] and Dynamic Programming [O(N*M)] approaches are already discussed here. In this article, we will discuss a linear time approach to find LCS using suffix tree (The 5th Suffix Tree Application). Here we will build generalized suffix tree for […] Read More » Generalized Suffix Tree 1 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 17, 2014 In earlier suffix tree articles, we created suffix tree for one string and then we queried that tree for substring check, searching all patterns, longest repeated substring and built suffix array (All linear time operations). There are lots of other problems where multiple strings are involved. e.g. pattern searching in a text file or dictionary, […] Read More » Suffix Tree Application 4 – Build Linear Time Suffix Array Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 14, 2014 Given a string, build it’s Suffix Array We have already discussed following two ways of building suffix array: Naive O(n2Logn) algorithm Enhanced O(nLogn) algorithm Please go through these to have the basic understanding. Here we will see how to build suffix array in linear time using suffix tree. As a prerequisite, we must know how […] Read More » Suffix Tree Application 3 – Longest Repeated Substring Leave a comment | Filed under Strings Given a text string, find Longest Repeated Substring in the text. If there are more than one Longest Repeated Substrings, get any one of them. Longest Repeated Substring in GEEKSFORGEEKS is: GEEKS Longest Repeated Substring in AAAAAAAAAA is: AAAAAAAAA Longest Repeated Substring in ABCDEFG is: No repeated substring Longest Repeated Substring in ABABABA is: ABABA […] Read More » Suffix Tree Application 2 – Searching All Patterns Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 13, 2014 Given a text string and a pattern string, find all occurrences of the pattern in string. Few pattern searching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, Naive Algorithm, Finite Automata) are already discussed, which can be used for this check. Here we will discuss suffix tree based algorithm. In the 1st Suffix Tree Application (Substring Check), we saw how […] Read More » Suffix Tree Application 1 – Substring Check Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 8, 2014 Given a text string and a pattern string, check if pattern exists in text or not. Few pattern searching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, Naive Algorithm, Finite Automata) are already discussed, which can be used for this check. Here we will discuss suffix tree based algorithm. As a prerequisite, we must know how to build a suffix […] Read More » Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 6 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 4, 2014 This article is continuation of following five articles: Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 1 Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 2 Read More » Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 5 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings This article is continuation of following four articles: Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 1 Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 2 Read More » Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 4 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 1, 2014 This article is continuation of following three articles: Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 1 Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 2 Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 3 Read More » Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 3 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings October 30, 2014 This article is continuation of following two articles: Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 1 Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 2 Read More » Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 2 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings October 27, 2014 In Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 1, we have seen high level Ukkonen’s Algorithm. This 2nd part is continuation of Part 1. Read More » Ukkonen’s Suffix Tree Construction – Part 1 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings October 24, 2014 Suffix Tree is very useful in numerous string processing and computational biology problems.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by Read More » Pattern Searching using a Trie of all Suffixes Leave a comment | Filed under Strings August 29, 2014 Problem Statement: Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
