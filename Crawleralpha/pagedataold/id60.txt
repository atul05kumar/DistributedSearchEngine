Naive [O(N*M2)] and Dynamic Programming [O(N*M)] approaches are already discussed here. In this article, we will discuss a linear time approach to find LCS using suffix tree (The 5th Suffix Tree Application). Here we will build generalized suffix tree for […] Read More » Generalized Suffix Tree 1 Leave a comment | Filed under Strings November 17, 2014 In earlier suffix tree articles, we created suffix tree for one string and then we queried that tree for substring check, searching all patterns, longest repeated substring and built suffix array (All linear time operations). There are lots of other problems where multiple strings are involved. e.g. pattern searching in a text file or dictionary, […] Read More » Vertex Cover Problem | Set 1 (Introduction and Approximate Algorithm) Leave a comment | Filed under Graph A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that for every edge (u, v) of the graph, either ‘u’ or ‘v’ is in vertex cover.

Here we will see how to build suffix array in linear time using suffix tree. As a prerequisite, we must know how […] Read More » KLA Tencor Interview Experience Leave a comment | Filed under Interview Experiences Before my interview scheduled i tried but could not find any recent interview of KLA Tencor, so i am sharing my own to help you guys.
