For example, if the given number is 23 (00010111), it should be converted to 43 (00101011). Read More » Add two bit strings 13 Comments | Filed under Bit Magic February 15, 2013 Given two bit sequences as strings, write a function to return the addition of the two sequences. Bit strings can be of different lengths also. For example, if string 1 is “1100011” and second string 2 is “10”, then the function should return “1100101”. Read More » Write your own strcmp that ignores cases 25 Comments | Filed under Bit Magic December 19, 2012 Write a modified strcmp function which ignores cases and returns -1 if s1 < s2, 0 if s1 = s2, else returns 1. For example, your strcmp should consider “GeeksforGeeks” and “geeksforgeeks” as same string.
