The actor trained Sooraj Pancholi and is also producing his debut film. According to a video story in TOI, Salman Khan recently invited newcomers Sooraj Pancholi and Athiya Shetty’s parents to watch portions of their debut film Hero. According to sources, the original plan was that only Salman Khan would watch the rushes with the director Nikhil Advani. However, Salman was so impressed with the first look of the film that he also invited Suniel and Manna Shetty, Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahib to watch the film’s rushes along with the lead pair.  /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/eventshow/45297953.cms 01 When it comes to mentoring newcomers, the bhai of Bollywood seems to go all out to promote the talent he believes in. The actor has constantly launched new faces and also revived careers of many who weren't getting roles for a long time. So it was no surprise when Salman took Armaan Kohli under his aegis, post his stint in the last edition of Bigg Boss. Armaan soon bagged a role in Sooraj Barjatya's Salman-starrer Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo. However, the actor didn't limit himself to just one film. According to a report in Mid-day, Armaan has inked a two-film deal with Sajid Nadiadwala who has had a super successful year so far. The report quotes a source as saying that Armaan had a meeting with the filmmaker at the end of which he bagged two projects. He also went on to say that the actor has been in touch with the host of Bigg Boss who has been recommending him to the filmmakers he is close to. Armaan chose to be rather diplomatic in the report and thanked no one in particular.  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682825.cms 02 Salman has always lent a helping hand to his close ones.

"For me my inspiration is Salman Khan. He is a true rock star that the industry has and inspite of the amount of success he has received he is still the same. He was the same person in Maine Pyar Kiya as he is in Dabangg 2. He has never changed as a human," said Pulkit. "He has his principles and he has stuck to them and I actually hope I can become a human being like Salman," he added. On being asked whether he seeks help or feedback from the Dabangg Khan, Pulkit said, "I think he is so experienced that it's scary to get any kind of praise from him. I don't mind feedback, but praise from him becomes a responsibility for me. Everybody loves him and I am lucky that he loves me."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682738.cms 04 Salman has also trained his Veer co-star Zarine Khan. The actor reportedly guided her on her quest to fitness. Salman is also Zarine's friend. In an interview to TOI, Zarine said, "I'm loving the attention. I was written-off after my debut in Veer. Now, steadily, the perception is changing. Yet, people aren't always noticing my acting skills. My weight has become a national issue. Even on the internet, I see that my weight is a point of constant discussions. And I fail to understand why. Aren't Indian women known for being voluptuous. Indian men don't even like thin women, so why is everyone trying to look like ramp models from the West? Where is our uniqueness and individuality then."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682598.cms 05 Govinda who has been Salman Khan's partner has also been trained by Salman on his weight.

In an interview to TOI before Jai Ho released, Santosh said, "I trained for the action sequences with a special trainer but Salman bhai was not happy with my training and looks. So he decided to train me with the help of his personal trainer Rakesh. All three of us go to bhai's farmhouse in Mumbai and then he runs with me for 10 kms. Once we are done with that, he makes me do 400 push-ups of 25 sets each and 300 crunches. He has made me lose 15 kgs! And finally, after so much training, he is happy with my new lean avatar."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682490.cms 07 The list of people that Salman has helped establish themselves in the film industry, is endless. Jacqueline Fernandez took Urdu lessons for her de-glam role in Kick. The actress has allegedly been trained by Salman on her Hindi diction too. In an interview to TOI, Jacqueline said, "Besides entertaining us, Salman would give me amazing inputs between the shots. His funny lines would do the trick. He wouldn't just work for himself, he would help me out saying, 'Ok, now try this out'. He need not do so, but that is the way he is."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682397.cms 08 Daisy Shah, who made her Bollywood debut in Jai Ho has also been trained by Salman Khan. Daisy Shah, who shared screen-space with Salman, was advised by him on how things function in the industry and how should she conduct herself in front of the media. Daisy is a simple girl and Salman had asked her to keep her simplicity intact. A spokesperson confirmed the news and added, "Daisy does not belong to a film background, so as Salman is launching her he is also going to groom her for the industry."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682350.cms 09 Salman Khan, who launched Sonakshi Sinha in Dabangg also trained her to reduce weight and get in shape. In an interview to TOI, Salman said, "Sonakshi is looking very good. I always knew that she had it in her to knock off the weight. Before coming to me for Dabangg, Sonakshi had lost some 16-odd kilos. Recently, she realised she needed to shed off another five-six kilos. But she wasn't doing it. Somewhere around my birthday, when I saw Sona, I realised that she had suddenly made up her mind to knock-off those additional kilos. And boy oh boy, she has done it. She's a pretty girl and a knockout actress. If she keeps her weight in check, there's no stopping her."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan /10-celebs-mentored-by-salman-khan/Top-10-celebs-who-Salman-Khan-guided-in-Bollywood/eventshow/39682302.cms 10 Arjun Kapoor who is currently enjoying all the appreciation coming his way for his role in 2 States also has Salman Khan to thank for his foray in Bollywood.

I've yet to achieve my best shape."  10 celebs mentored by Salman Khan 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 pagination.cms?msid=39682209&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
