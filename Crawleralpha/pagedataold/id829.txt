Choukhmane and Franco have presented a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the maximum independent set problem in cubic planar graphs. If M is taken as the ratio of the size of the independent set produced by their algorithm to the size of a maximum independent set of the input graph, then they show that their algorithm gives M ⩾ 6/7 for any cubic planar graph and M ⩾ 7/8 for a triangle-free cubic planar graph. We give a new, stronger proof of thier result. The new proof shows that their algorithm actually gives M ⩾ 7/8 for all cubic planar graphs.
