 //input =xyz abc //output=xyz abc Silent suppose we have a derived class having an abstract base class, now if we create an object of derived class then its base subobject will not be created in it, right?? because we can not create an object of an abstract class.. then why is it necessary to define the pure virtual destructor in the abstract base class if it’s object will never be created even as a subobject of a derived class?? please clarify my doubt asap.. Kartik You seem to confusing yourself about abstract class. There is nothing like subobject. An abstract class can have constructors also and the constructors are called when create an object of derived class. See following example: The program works fine and prints 10. #include using namespace std; class Base { int x; public: virtual void fun()=0; Base(int i) { x = i; } int getX() {return x;} }; class Derived: public Base { public: Derived(int i):Base(i) {} void fun() { } }; int main() { Derived d(10); cout << d.getX(); } Silent suppose we have a derived class having an abstract base class, now if we create an object of derived class then its base subobject will not be created in it, right?? because we can not create an object of an abstract class.. then why is it necessary to define the pure virtual destructor in the abstract base class if it’s object will never be created even as a subobject of a derived class?? please clarify my doubt asap..

 rogerr Can someone please suggest a concise and good resource to practice/learn object oriented design. For example, answers to questions like “Make object oriented design for phone book”, etc. ?? http://nowebsiteURI nithish #include #include #define INF 1000 char vertex[10]; int wght[10][10]; int span_wght[10][10]; int source; struct sort { int v1,v2; int weight; }que[20]; int n,ed,f,r; int cycle(int s,int d) { int j,k; if(source==d) return 1; for(j=0;j<n;j++) if(span_wght[d][j]!=INF&&s!=j) { if(cycle(d,j)) return 1; } return 0; } void build_tree() { int i,j,k,w,count=0; for(count=0;count<n;f++) { i=que[f].v1; j=que[f].v2; w=que[f].weight; span_wght[i][j]=span_wght[j][i]=w; source=i; k=cycle(i,j); if(k) span_wght[i][j]=span_wght[j][i]=INF; else count++; } } void swap(int *i,int *j) { int t; t=*i; *i=*j; *j=t; } void main() { int i,j,k=0,temp; int sum=0; clrscr(); cout<<"\n\n Kruskal's algorithm to find spanning tree \n\n"; cout<>n; for(i=0;i<n;i++) { cout<>vertex[i]; for(j=0;j<n;j++) { wght[i][j]=INF; span_wght[i][j]=INF; } } cout<<"\n\n Getting weight \n"; for(i=0;i<n;i++) for(j=i+1;j<n;j++) { cout<>ed; if(ed>=1) { wght[i][j]=wght[j][i]=ed; que[r].v1=i; que[r].v2=j; que[r].weight=wght[i][j]; if(r) { for(k=0;kque[r].weight) { swap(&que[k].weight,&que[r].weight); swap(&que[k].v1,&que[r].v1); swap(&que[k].v2,&que[r].v2); } } r++; } } clrscr(); cout<<"\n\t ORIGINAL GRAPH WEIGHT MATRIX \n\n"; cout<<"\n\t WEIGHT MATRIX\n\n"; for(i=0;i<n;i++) cout<<"\n\t"; for(j=0;j<n;j++) cout<<"\n\t"; cout<<"wght[i][j]"; build_tree; cout<<"\n\n MINIMUM SPANNING TREE \n\n"; cout<<"\n\t LIST OF EDGES"; for(i=0;i<n;i++) for(j=i+1;j<n;j++) if(span_wght[i][j]!=INF) { cout<<"vertex[i],vertex[j],span_wght[i][j]"; sum+=span_wght[i][j]; } cout<<"\n\n\t Total Weight",sum; getch(); } this is my code and my question is write a c++ program to find minimum spanning tree for a given graph using kruskal's algorithm ram Hi , in output questions, set 12 , set 13 and set 14 are the same . GeeksforGeeks @ram: Thanks for pointing this out. We have fixed the links. rajivchandel Hello man, just correct the spelling of new in “nee and delete” @ http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/

 GeeksforGeeks Done. Thanks for pointing this out. http://www.algocoders.com Algocoders Where do I get to see the concepts getting implemented strictly using C++11 language and library features? I will prefer a simple library to start using it right away. ram u r knucklehead, use gcc on any latest linux .
