Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks. push1(int x) –> pushes x to first stack push2(int x) –> pushes x to second stack pop1() –> pops an element from first stack and return the popped element pop2() –> pops an element from second stack and return the popped element Implementation of twoStack should be space efficient. Method 1 (Divide the space in two halves) A simple way to implement two stacks is to divide the array in two halves and assign the half half space to two stacks, i.e., use arr[0] to arr[n/2] for stack1, and arr[n/2+1] to arr[n-1] for stack2 where arr[] is the array to be used to implement two stacks and size of array be n. The problem with this method is inefficient use of array space. A stack push operation may result in stack overflow even if there is space available in arr[]. For example, say the array size is 6 and we push 3 elements to stack1 and do not push anything to second stack2. When we push 4th element to stack1, there will be overflow even if we have space for 3 more elements in array. Method 2 (A space efficient implementation) This method efficiently utilizes the available space. It doesn’t cause an overflow if there is space available in arr[]. The idea is to start two stacks from two extreme corners of arr[]. stack1 starts from the leftmost element, the first element in stack1 is pushed at index 0. The stack2 starts from the rightmost corner, the first element in stack2 is pushed at index (n-1). Both stacks grow (or shrink) in opposite direction. To check for overflow, all we need to check is for space between top elements of both stacks. This check is highlighted in the below code. 
#include<iostream>
#include<stdlib.h>

using namespace std;

class twoStacks
{
    int *arr;
    int size;
    int top1, top2;
public:
   twoStacks(int n)  // constructor
   {
       size = n;
       arr = new int[n];
       top1 = -1;
       top2 = size;
   }

   // Method to push an element x to stack1
   void push1(int x)
   {
       // There is at least one empty space for new element
       if (top1 < top2 - 1)
       {
           top1++;
           arr[top1] = x;
       }
       else
       {
           cout << "Stack Overflow";
           exit(1);
       }
   }

   // Method to push an element x to stack2
   void push2(int x)
   {
       // There is at least one empty space for new element
       if (top1 < top2 - 1)
       {
           top2--;
           arr[top2] = x;
       }
       else
       {
           cout << "Stack Overflow";
           exit(1);
       }
   }

   // Method to pop an element from first stack
   int pop1()
   {
       if (top1 >= 0 )
       {
          int x = arr[top1];
          top1--;
          return x;
       }
       else
       {
           cout << "Stack UnderFlow";
           exit(1);
       }
   }

   // Method to pop an element from second stack
   int pop2()
   {
       if (top2 < size)
       {
          int x = arr[top2];
          top2++;
          return x;
       }
       else
       {
           cout << "Stack UnderFlow";
           exit(1);

 Geek Even Better Memory optimized solution.. 1) push everything from start 2) Create link lists inside array.. say input order: which stack it should go stack 1 : 10 stack 2 : 12 stack 2 : 16 stack 1 : 1 stack 2 : 23 answer is: 
        ______________
       |     |       |
10    12    16   1  23

 Seema Great work! Keep it on! Krupa Making 2-stacks in the method(2) presented above is nothing but how OS can manage the stack and heap both growing in reverse direction. Its simple solution. test test Inderpreet Singh Best Stuff. It’s very easy to understand. I tried to understand this concept many times before this post was written but i could not. After reading this post, i understood it . Thanks Man and Thanks GeeksforGeeks. http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/alumni/~suhas08/ suhas meena In Second method while we do pop operation. Their is a case that while we pop stack 2 items we may pop stack 1 first item because we are not differentiating between items of two stack. Correct me if i am wrong.  
/* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
 kartik That is not possible because there are two different top variables and different conditions to check underflow. kunal you people provide the best stuff to crack interview keep it on laxmi like your explanation Other Neo The code look amateur “C” code written at the very best…. 1. push1 and push2 do not return the error/exception to the caller 2. Big Blunder in terms of EXIT(0) 3. Duplicate code with respect to push1 & push2 and pop1 and pop2. Ideally push and pop should take the parameter about the stack on which to operate kartik @Other Neo: Thanks for your inputs. The coding is done this way to keep code small and simple. Could you provide more details or reference about the problem with exit(0). Also, all code in push1() and push2() not duplicatae, it’s just the overflow handling part. The push1() operations does top1++ and push2() does top1–. Similarly pop1() and pop2() are not duplicate. Other Neo @Kartik “exit(0)” are old rudimentary ways for error handling done by really old code. exit(0) in any code just shows the arrogance of the code / programmer. It breaks all the call chain (behaving more like goto) and closes the program without any possibility of recovery. In your code the instead of EXIT(0) you could have simply written RETURN FALSE and thus provide the opportunity to the caller of the function (main) to deal with the error. PUSH functions are exact duplicates of each other if we ignore the comparison and increment/decrement; and the same goes with POP. For illustration if the implementation was to change from a static array to std::vector, you would need to change code twice for POP and twice for PUSH. If you are still not convinced let me know and I will rewrite the whole code. lalor I hope you give the whole code.
