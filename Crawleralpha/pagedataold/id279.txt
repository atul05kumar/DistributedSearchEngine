But the actress, who had taken a sabbatical post films, maintains that she hadn't done anything scandalous when she was at the peak of her career and wouldn't attempt to do any now as well. According to a Mumbai Mirror report, the actress seems to be in a good space, choosing films that she would enjoy doing. She asserts in the report that she doesn't need to work given the fact that her husband was financially well-off and she would rather stay at home and watch her son's tooth fall than dart from one studio to the next, minting money. The actress who will be seen in Anurag Kashyap's Bombay Velvet, is humble enough to accept that hers is a cameo and she would be grateful if her scenes aren't chopped off on the editing table. Besides, Raveena is also doing Onir's Shab that she was earlier offered ten years ago but couldn't take it up due to her pregnancy. The rumour mill was abuzz with reports that Raveena had stepped in to replace Sangeeta Bijlani who had walked out of the project due to the alleged lovemaking scenes. Brushing it off, Raveena insists that she was always the first choice for the film. When asked if she was comfortable doing intimate scenes, she clarifies, "There aren't any love-making scenes in the film. Onir has rewritten the script for me. He came to me and asked if I would do kissing scenes, I put my foot down. I didn't do such scenes during the peak of my career, so why would I indulge in them now?" Read on to know what other actors have to say about doing intimate scenes in front of the camera.  /bollywood-celebs-talk-about-intimate-scenes/eventshow/45303958.cms 01 Raveena Tandon's sexy siren act in 'Tip tip barsa...' was sensuous in its appeal.

But apparently Bipasha prefers to be left alone while doing intimate scenes or so claims a report in Mid-day. The report states that the actress was recently shooting for a rather intimate scene for her upcoming film Alone with co-actor Karan Singh Grover at Mehboob Studios. Dressed in quite a skimpy outfit that showed off her curves, the actress insisted that only those involved with the actual shooting of the scene be present. The others were shown the door till the scene was approved of by the director. However, in the past the actress has expressed her level of comfort in doing scenes that involve physical intimacy. In an interview to TOI, the actress had said, "In my life of 50 films, it (intimate scenes) must have happened some 15 times. So, it's very less. Physical intimacy - it's something I am totally comfortable with. It doesn't really bother me."  Bollywood celebs talk about intimate scenes /bollywood-celebs-talk-about-intimate-scenes/eventshow/33071155.cms 03 Ranbir and Deepika grabbed attention with their affair and later with their break-up. However, Deepika isn't uncomfortable with her ex-flame and claims that performing with Ranbir is okay. "I think the fact that we are comfortable with each other whether it's intimate scenes, romantic scenes or angry scenes or action scenes. The fact remains that we are comfortable working with each other and that's why we signed the film," said Deepika. "When you are doing scenes we don't think like ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend we are there as characters," added the actress.  Bollywood celebs talk about intimate scenes /bollywood-celebs-talk-about-intimate-scenes/eventshow/33073866.cms 04 Pooja Chopra, who entered Bollywood with Commando-A One Man Army spoke to TOI and confessed her shyness when it comes to doing intimate scenes on the silver screen. The model turned actress speaks straight from the heart and objects to following the trends blindly and claims, "Yes, I do have inhibitions for intimate and bikini scenes. I come from a middle class family and follow values. In fact, even to hug Vidyut we used to think about it. I am a modern girl, but I am more traditional than any other girl. I will never do an intimate or bikini scene. During the course of time I don't know whether I will change. I am happy about family films."  Bollywood celebs talk about intimate scenes /bollywood-celebs-talk-about-intimate-scenes/eventshow/33073837.cms 05 Manish Paul, who entered Bollywood with Mickey Virus indulged in an intimate scene in the film. When asked about any inhibitions as an actor, Manish said, "I don't have any inhibitions. I am very comfortable and I had to take off my shirt in the film too. I have to specially mention the name of Praveen Nair, who took care of my diet and workout regime so that I look sexy and hot in my film. People are only approaching me for comedy, but I can do action too. I am an actor and that is for my producers to decide."  Bollywood celebs talk about intimate scenes /bollywood-celebs-talk-about-intimate-scenes/eventshow/33071208.cms 06 Sonal Chauhan, who was seen in the Bollywood film 3G in an exclusive conversation with TOI, spoke about her initial inhibitions for doing bikini and intimate scenes on-screen.

"My co-star got nervous when we shot for intimate scenes in Nasha. When it comes to me I enjoyed shooting for all the scenes," said Poonam. While talking about intimate scenes, Poonam said, "It's my work and if I won't do scenes with comfort, they won't look good on-screen. As an actress I don't know, but as a person I don't think it's wrong. Sex is not a big deal in relationships. You are not doing anything wrong by kissing your lover."  Bollywood celebs talk about intimate scenes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 pagination.cms?msid=33071135&curpg=1 Post another comment Share your views - post your comment below We encourage you to log in and comment.
