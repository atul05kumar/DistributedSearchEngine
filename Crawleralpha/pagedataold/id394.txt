Much like their not-so-popular counterparts, these celebrities hangout with their friends when they are not jet-setting off for a shoot and an urge to share their pics with each other and the rest of the world is obvious. That probably explains why Anushka Sharma is all set to open an account on Facebook. The actress, who has over 3.5 million followers on Twitter, wants to now be active on FB too. What's more? The actress acknowledges that the step is encouraged by her fans and hence has asked them to create a picture that would be her first cover picture on Facebook.

The girl is super active on Twitter and keeps posting selfies of herself enjoying her spot under the sun. Not the one to keep her thoughts to herself, the actress tweets about a lot of things apart from her releases. Unlike other celebs who choose to keep their personal and private lives separate, Shraddha is often seen sharing pics of her parties and hangouts with non-industry friends. Speaking about her decision to be online, Shraddha says, "Social media has changed the way we communicate. The best part of it according to me is to be able to keep in touch with your fans! There is no better feeling. When I give an interview, it is a journalist's interpretation of what I have spoken to him/her but on social media it is just me. I feel a sense of freedom of expression and also people know that what I am saying isn't fabricated or being put across through a lens of another person." So, for Shraddha it is the freedom of expression that tempts her to log in.  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189817.cms 03 He had a dream debut with Karan Johar's Student of the Year and hasn't looked back. Following it up with hits like Hasee Toh Phasee and Ek Villain, the young lad loves interacting with his fans on social networking sites. With a total of 1.19 million followers, Sidharth is quite interactive on the medium and is often seen initiating random chats with fans. Besides, he also shares details of his workout sessions, bikes and love for movies on the micro-blogging site. "Connecting on social media gives us a chance to directly interact with our fans. It gives us the freedom to express our views freely and get feedback instantly," opines Sidharth. Prabhat Choudhary from Spice, a communication agency that handles film promotions and celebrity portfolios, says, "Social media comes naturally to the new generation of actors. They are going online for everything - promote their film, interact with fans and also shop on the go."  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189814.cms 04 Alia Bhatt is a complete social media addict. She keeps sharing her many selfies online and loves the feedback she gets. The actress doesn't care about media speculations, and throwing caution to the wind, shares pictures of herself with her co-stars online. Despite all the link-ups, she shares candid pictures from the sets or promotional activities. She has often also shared pics of herself with her dad. As Prabhat rightly points out, "Even if these actors were not celebrities, they would have had social media profiles and their celebrity status doesn't affect them."  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189808.cms 05 Sonam Kapoor sure loves her selfies.

Sonam is also one of the few celebs who actually interacts with her friends and fans on the site.  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189801.cms 06 From sharing pictures of her first tattoo to divulging details of her new haircut, Sonakshi Sinha is one media savvy girl! She sure loves the camera and is selfie-obssessed too. Her profile is filled with pictures of herself with her favourite people. The actress also doesn't shy away from picking fights on the site if she believes that she is standing up for the right thing. Recently when Kamaal R Khan tweeted some defamatory stuff against other actresses, Sonakshi Sinha tweeted, "Please RT this if u think @kamaalrkhan is a woman disrespecting waste of space and deserves to be hung upside down and given 4 tight slaps." Way to go girl!  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189797.cms 07 Arjun Kapoor is relatively new to the social media world but that doesn't mean that he is not rocking the space already. Having joined Twitter on his birthday this year, the actor gets tips from younger sister Anshula Kapoor on how to manage his profile. And though the actor mostly shares details of his films with his fans, there also are some words of wisdom tweets embedded in between. Though Arjun is not exactly a party person, he does share details of his outings on his profile ever so often.  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189796.cms 08 Jacqueline Fernandez loves herself or so says her Instagram profile. The actress is in love with the camera, so much so that she keeps sharing pictures of herself posing and preening at the lens.

Her friends and family also get a special mention on her profile and the actress loves basking in all the attention that comes her way on these sites.  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189794.cms 09 The spunky actor is quite active on social media. With a penchant for being quirky in a rather fun manner, Varun Dhawan's swag screams out loud from his profile. He often tweets congratulatory messages for industry friends and keeps sharing candid pictures of himself and his co-stars from the sets. He is also one of those actors who don't shy away from sharing pictures of their private parties. Varun's profile has many such pictures where he can be seen having a good time with non-industry as well as industry friends. While actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is Varun's contemporary chooses not to be online lest his private life goes public, we wonder how the Dhawan dude doesn't mind putting his life under public scrutiny. "It's about the person. If a certain person is private in real life, they will prefer not to go online and vice versa," reasons Prabhat. Ask him security is also a concern for celebs since a lot of fake profiles also do the rounds and hackers always target celeb profiles and he quips, "Security is an issue but these celebs are quite savvy. There are certain ways to verify accounts and that has solved the problem largely."  Celebs who use social media for reasons apart from promotions /celebs-who-use-social-media-for-reasons-apart-from-promotions/eventshow/45189792.cms 10 Ileana D'Cruz is an Instagram addict.
