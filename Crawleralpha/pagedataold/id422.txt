int fun(int arr[], int n)
{
    int x = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        x = x ^ arr[i];
    return x;
}
 A 0 B 9 C 12 D 2 Discuss it Question 1 Explanation:  Note that 9 is the only element with odd occurrences, all other elements have even occurrences. If the input array has all elements with even occurrences except one, then the function returns the only element with odd occurrences. Note that XORing an element with itself results 0 and XOR of 0 with a number x is equal to x. Try following complete program. 
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fun(int arr[], int n)
{
    int x = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        x = x ^ arr[i];
    return x;
}

int main()
{
  int arr[] = {9, 12, 2, 11, 10, 9, 12, 10, 9, 11, 2};
  int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
  cout << fun(arr, n) << endl;
  return 0;
} Question 2 What does the following C expression do? x = (x<<1) + x + (x>>1); A Multiplies an integer with 7 B Multiplies an integer with 3.5 C Multiplies an integer with 3 D Multiplies an integer with 8 Discuss it Question 2 Explanation:  The expression multiplies an integer with 3.5. For example, if x is 4, the expression returns 15. If x is 6, it returns 21. If x is 5, it return 17. See Multiply a given Integer with 3.5 for more details. Question 3 What does the following C expression do?  x = x & (x-1) A Sets all bits as 1 B Makes x equals to 0 C Turns of the rightmost set bit D Turns of the leftmost set bit Discuss it Question 3 Explanation:  The expression simply turns off the rightmost set bit. For example, if x = 14 (1110), it returns 12 (1100) Question 4 Given two arrays of numbers a1, a2, a3,...an and b1, b2, .. bn where each number is 0 or 1, the fastest algorithm to find the largest span(i, j) such that ai + ai+1, ....aj = bi, bi+1, .. bj. or report that there is not such span, A Takes O(n3) and Ω(2n) time if hashing is permitted B Takes O(n3) and Ω(n2.5) time in the key comparison model C Takes θ(n) time and space D Takes O(√n) time only if the sum of the 2n elements is an even number Discuss it There are 4 questions to complete.
