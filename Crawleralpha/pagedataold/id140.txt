ECCC - Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity 2014 2013 2012 2014...1994 WEBSITE > HOME: What we do and why The Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity is a new forum for the rapid and widespread interchange of ideas, techniques, and research in computational complexity. The purpose of this Colloquium is to use electronic media for scientific communication and discussions in the computational complexity community. The Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC) welcomes papers, short notes and surveys with relevance to the theory of computation, clear mathematical profile and strictly mathematical format. Central topics models of computation and their complexity, trade-off results, complexity bounds (with the emphasis on lower bounds). Specific areas including complexity issues are combinatorics, communication complexity, cryptography, combinatorial optimization, complexity of learning algorithms, logic.

In this work, we study and highlight the interrelationships between several such algebraic objects such as subspace designs, dimension ... more >>> TR14-161 | 27th November 2014 Rahul Arora, Ashu Gupta, Rohit Gurjar, Raghunath Tewari Derandomizing Isolation Lemma for $K_{3,3}$-free and $K_5$-free Bipartite Graphs The perfect matching problem has a randomized $NC$ algorithm, using the celebrated Isolation Lemma of Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani. The Isolation Lemma states that giving a random weight assignment to the edges of a graph, ensures that it has a unique minimum weight perfect matching, with a good probability. We ... more >>> TR14-160 | 27th November 2014 Gil Cohen, Igor Shinkar Zero-Fixing Extractors for Sub-Logarithmic Entropy An $(n,k)$-bit-fixing source is a distribution on $n$ bit strings, that is fixed on $n-k$ of the coordinates, and jointly uniform on the remaining $k$ bits. Explicit constructions of bit-fixing extractors by Gabizon, Raz and Shaltiel [SICOMP 2006] and Rao [CCC 2009], extract $(1-o(1)) \cdot k$ bits for $k = ... more >>> -> Older reports ISSN 1433-8092 | Imprint
